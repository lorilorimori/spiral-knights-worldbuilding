Spiral Knights had proven to be able to captivate as a setting and a story. In this analysis we aim to provide an exhaustive answer why Spiral Knights succeeds in those areas and from which of its components and their chemistry setting's worldbuilding potential emerges.

<!--Then we indent to indentify how answers to those questions render Spiral Knights' setting as a _postmodern heroic epic_.-->

We will present a set of narrative devices and tropes within a constructed system of symbols the setting may have utilized to present an immersive and believable aesthetics of a fictional universe.

---

## Motivation

The present analysis is meant to identify, analyze and explore:

- Worldbuilding
- Themes
- Characters
- Stories
- Symbolism
- Plots
- Culture
- Myths
- Narratives, which create a __sence of depth__ of [Spiral Knights](https://www.spiralknights.com/) fictional universe.

As fiction is set in its own separate reality, it can imitate depth of its world only far enough by obfuscating its boundaries up to a certain limit. By exploring the volume a fiction offers, we intend to identify the __underlying system__ of narrative, thematic and symbolic relations between devices and tropes, -- the bonding quality, found through aesthetics, _which allows for setting's ability to captivate_ as a fictional world, a gamified microcosm, a story, and a reflection of real-world cultures.

### Approach to Worldbuilding

Design of the world as an interconnected system of its components -- the process of worldbuilding, -- is usually found through in-universe laws, symbolism, themes, characters, factions, environments, etc., their relations and history.

While worldbuilding adds depth to the initial setting, we believe __Spiral Knights can exist as a captivating setting without an expansive logic underpinning it__. Here, conversely, we argue that the setting is written consistently enough to allow such worldbuilding to emerge organically through engagement with the source material.

We will rely on the in-universe accounts -- descriptions, character dialogue, item descriptions, etc., -- as signs of physical and historical processees outside the observable location of the setting at any given moment. This immersive form of experiencing the world, a _watsonian_ perspective, is one we will primarily focus on.

The other essential component of this analysis we base in recognition of the subjects the fictional setting offers as rooted in __aesthetics-first approach__. Those aesthetics emerge, as we will propose, from an __interplay of medievalism and cyberpunk__, among other elemnts of a broader genre of _speculative fiction_. The resulting perceived consistency of the symbols then may be explained by a common experiences not limited to popular culture on its own.

With this thought framework in mind, we will go through the entirety of the story, worldbuilding and lore of Spiral Knights, backed by the analysis of every dialogue, item description and designs, perceived as relevant to a discussed topic in attempt to create a coherent, immersive and believable narrative which would inderpin and categorize the feel and impression of the setting as a sytsem of symbols.

We will analyze the setting without including details of technical impimentation, but view it at a face value, apart from elements requiring elaboration as they have changed over the development of the game since its initial release.

We acknowledge that there are undiscovered or missed inspirations and themes, which we may not be aware of.

## Method

The analysis is performed in two steps. First, we construct a timeline out of in-universe history through arrangement of a causally cohesive sequence of events, plots, and corresponding characters' actions. The guiding principle of this step is the achievement of a subjectively and thematically satisfying closure of identified narratives. The second step uses the timeline to find more exapansive tropes from the initial subject and its identified tropes while going through the present setting at face value.

The timeline is not considered a single true representation of events, but rather it is an exploration, analysis, and extrapolation of a series of educated guesses based on the in-game materials.

__As far as the subject of discussion follows, any resemblence to real-life events or characters could be purely coincidental__.

In order to achieve desired level of cohesiveness of the research, we will outline some rules for our scope of work:

- The official game, its DLCs, special and annual events are used in the construction of the timeline.

    Events and several content updates match announcements on the [forums](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/forum/8), and as those are framed in an in-universe medium, -- as memorandums, -- we will include those into the analysis.

    From the forums, we will also include [Clockworks Confidential](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Credits#Clockworks_Confidential) into the scope of our analysis.

- We will rely on the official wiki for the most of descriptions of items, regions, etc., but as some [content mey be absent or not documented on the wiki](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/SpiralKnights:General_disclaimer), we will present the precise source and location for those materials as we reference them.

    Entries on the [wiki](https://wiki.spiralknights.com) credited to developers of the game are included into the analysis. Some of those entries are not present in the most recent versions of their pages, so we will use the latest appearance of those snippets from pages' edit history.

    The wiki contains materials [exclusive](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall) for it _as a storytelling medium and source of truth_. We will assume them to exsit in-universe.

- Arcade and rank missions define setting's world. Arcade specifically is considered a tool of environmental storytelling, serving as thematic foundation for the setting, including context of rank missions.

    We assume that crafting of the equipment, refered as alchemy, is generally done with the intended materials. If an inconcistency between description and recipe is found, we attempt to present first the in-universe explanation.

    <!--We consider all present items, weapons, and equipment to be incorporated into corresponding in-universe narratives, indefinite of their [out-of-universe or Doylist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist) origin and refernce to other works of fiction.-->

- We assume _consistency of themes_. It suggests that both the narrative and the story are complete. We rely on the assumption that the stories and involved in them _characters possess conclusive motivations and goals_ despite the storytelling medium being an MMO with corresponding for such genre design choices and priorities.

    The potential inspirations, relations to folklore, mythology, and fiction will be introduced wherein we believe they might present a plausible explanation for elements of the identified narratives.

    The justification for any event or characters' actions will be discussed from the in-universe perspective.

### _Chapter `I` &#160;<br>_ Cosmology

<SubTitleCentered>

<em>"Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars." <small>- Allister Danford</small></em>

</SubTitleCentered>

At first, we will establish rough outline of the cosmology based on rank missions' briefings, dialogues, items, and equipment. Currently we are not concerned with exact in-universe laws, under which each dimension or realm operates, but with their general themes and initial premise.

While we believe both _in-universe physical laws_ and _symbolic themes_ are important for the _color-coded setting_, found in damage types and enemy classifications, with no knowledge of the prior, we can rely only on discovered visual patterns, and from them we can derive common principles.

Then, we will attempt to find symbolic elements and cross-reference those with mythology and folklore -- as stories, or narratives, -- found across multitude of cultures, as they will be _the scaffolding and approximate guidelines_ for our theory on what we judge to be thematically and narratively fitting from a storytelling perspective.

#### Material Realm

Rank mission [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness) describes an encompassing realm of the setting of Cradle: `The undead on the other hand remain a mystery. Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)).

As Cradle is the current main location of the setting, we need to label and distinguish it's encompassing dimension from the others, so we will use this term -- material realm.

#### Underworld

Underworld is mentioned in [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness) as the other realm: `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld. While how they crossed over and what their motives are on Cradle is unclear, data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us. The undead on the other hand remain a mystery. Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds`.

This description does not explicitly specify source of returning spirits, but, due to both undead and fiend families of monsters dealing shadow damage, we can suggest that the place of origin of those spirits is one to be either Underworld itself or a currently unknown, adjacent location, which shares property of distinctly shadow damage.

The connection of spirits returning to the material realm followed by `The undead on the other hand remain a mystery` strongly suggests that __undead are the very result of spirits returning to the material realm__.

Underworld, while is described to be `speculated` by in-universe authors of the description, is so far the only realm with a relation to fiends, both through its culturally-significants name and as a habitat.

It is the supposed original dimension for the fiendish ecosystem, such as [greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver) and [gorgos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo). Fiendish nature is native to the Underworld and effects of its presence on material realm will be closely observed throughout the timeline.

Underworld is the homeworld for [devilites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite), who are considered the workforce of the Underworld, as specified by the information module of [Devilish Drudgery](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilish_Drudgery): `The office minions of the Underworld are a disgruntled lot, attacking any unauthorized personnel on sight. While not terrible threats on their own, they can become far worse if one of their Pit Bosses gets a hold of them`.

Based on mission's name and description of [White Collar Captives](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/White_collar_captives): `Devilites ... will do anything to look like they're being productive. Unfortunately, productivity is often defined by attacking or imprisoning intruders, like a squad of knights passing through. It is unclear what purpose imprisoned knights would ultimately serve in a devilite agenda. Those that have survived captivity have reported that conditions were poor, but the worst of it was the copious amounts of paperwork they had to fill out daily`, devilites are considered by Spiral Order also as the office workers of a currently unnamed company. That it is, if missions' descriptions are written by Spiral Order researchers. Actual evidence for those descriptions will be discussed in relation to other topics, but so far, such assumption would suffice.

Here we also acquire one of the clues on the relation between Spiral Order and devilites:

- `A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand` ([White Collar Captives](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/White_collar_captives)).
- `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)).

Those references to Underworld and devilites, we may suggest, frame Spiral Order as ones who did not have an earlier opportunity to study devilites _potentially prior to Skylark crash landing on Cradle_, meaning that Underworld had remained undiscovered by Spiral Order in their past - before Cradle. It could be also a case of Spiral Order being vaguely aware of the Underworld, but the significant progress in its understanding was made only on Cradle. We will keep both interpretations in mind, without committing to any of those.

Yet, this lack of knowledge of deveilites contrasts a specificy of understanding of causal effects of shadow damage: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` ([The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)).

Considering this ambiguity, for now we will only acknowledge the characteristic lack of knowledge of the nature of devilites and greater Underworld but a degree of understanding of shadow damage itself.

#### Apocrean Realm

Apocrean Realm has a relation to the Underworld through presence of shadow damage, Undead, and [Lost Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul), as seen by the events of the [Shroud of Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea): [Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus), the [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau), as it contains [Freed Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul), Undead, including rare Dreadnoughts, and devilites, depending on plateau's layout, as well as the [Departure](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Departure), where souls are seen in most numeroues amount.

Lost soul is the one to introduce Shroud of Apocrea to Spiral Order in Haven, so the link between the two is partcularly important to understanding nature of both. In the Nexus, a lot of focus is drawn to the explicit goal of gathering resources to transmute several obsidian and Apocrea-themed weapons, which all possess shadow damage and character of Apocrean Harvestes in its appearance. Paralleling it, the a goal of capturing souls is established there: `The Apocrea are stuff of nightmares: a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life. Though you may venture beyond this nexus, you will undoubtedly fall into one of their traps along the way. The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap. In these traps they stalk any life, harvesting their souls for some unimaginable purpose` ([The Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus)).

##### Introduction of Souls

Here we should focus on tangible concept of souls, as they are presented already, although indirectly, in relation to Underworld, and more explicitly, to Apocrean Realm. Souls, as Lost souls, are present across many location of Cradle, including aforementioned Apocrean Realm and Underworld, graveyards, Firestorm Citadel, Dry Docks, in Frozen Highway of fiendish city Amu-Sol, and the Core.

During [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice) mission more information on the relation between Souls and Underworld is revealed:

- `The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff [everfrost] to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash ... souls into the Clockworks` ([Heart of Ice - Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower)).
- `A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` - [Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol)

Souls, ones that were suggested to be trapped in everfrost, which makes up _Everfrost Pillar delivered from Underworld_, we believe to be the same as the Lost Souls, or rather, [Frost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Frozen_Soul) variation encountered during the events of the [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice). This leads to us identify the location of origin of lost souls to be one related if not identical to Underworld - that __lost souls came from Underworld__.

Those souls may also potentially be ones referred as the spirits, with the general inclusion of the undead: `Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)), but, so far this is a speculation, but one, which mey establish a different metaphysical state of Cradle, wherein a connection between the assumed Underworld to be bi-directional, rather than an implied regular state of one-way downward movement of souls from the material realm into Underworld.

Those descriptions, as well as presence of lost souls in the [Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus) suggests that Apocrean Realm and Underworld are connected at least by the nature _of acknowledging existence of souls_, although nature of that connection is yet unknown.

#### Blinding Abyss

Blinding Abyss is one of a few realms which were not explicitly visited nor witnessed by Spiral Order.

It is a location closely related to frost, with its name is taken from [Fiendish Memo of Amu-Sol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol): `Thank you for your prompt response. Unfortunately your resource allocation has been denied. Reason: Provided summary of need for requested resources: 'All hail the great and terrifying Maulos, true lord of the Blinding Abyss'`. Despite being present only within a context of [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol), it has multiple Underworld entities tied with it, namely devilites, [Maulos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maulos#Maulos), and less explicitly, Morgral'm, the _Assistant Supervisor of Resource Allocations at Undercorp_ ([Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol))). Morgral'm reveals the name of this company, being Undercorp.

And, it is one of a few missions, where Undercorp is mentioned, suggesting it being the supposed corporation from the Underworld, currently and actively present on Cradle by the time Skylark has crash landed.

Judging by same reference to Maulos and his implied powers of the Eternal Frost, `It is our understanding that all Pit Boss duties, administrative and otherwise, have been turned over to a 'Maulos of the Eternal Frost,', is that correct?` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol)), while being a trojan, it is plausible for him to be an entity from the Underworld, yet far more powerful, compared to other trojans, as evident by his skull or helm.

Maulos will be examined later in the analysis with the [Underworld influences](#influences-of-underworld), but currently in the context of overall cosmology this initial understanding will be enough.

#### Nameless Realm

Nameless Realm is mentioned in the description of the [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak): `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` ([Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak)).

The implied duality of the phrase must be focused on, as this is the first instance of a distinctly more metaphysical phenomenon being described.

More so, we propose such characteristic is fairly reminiscent of the symbolism of alchemy -- the description and later covered context and properties of the Chaos Cloak of the Nameless Realm are reminiscent of alchemical First Matter and its chaos:

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

  The “treasure hard to attain,” whose presence was suspected in the dark prima materia, is symbolized by the alchemists in various ways. Christopher of Paris, for instance, says that the chaos (as prima materia) is the work of all-wise nature. Our understanding ... , aided by the “celestial and glowing spirit,” must transform this natural work of art —chaos— into the celestial nature of the quintessence, and into the life- giving (vegetabilis) essence of heaven. The precious substance is potentially contained in this chaos as a massa confusa of all the elements rolled into one, and man must diligently apply his mind to it so that “our heaven” may come into reality (ad actum).

  ...

  The earth (as prima materia) is not a dead body, but is inhabited by a spirit that is its life and soul. All created things, minerals included, draw their strength from the earth-spirit. This spirit is life, it is nourished by the stars, and it gives nourishment to all the living things ... This invisible spirit is like the reflection in a mirror, intangible, yet it is at the same time the root of all the substances necessary to the alchemical process or arising therefrom (radix nostrorum corporum).

</BookCitation>

Nature of Nameless Relam, at its basis, is characterized by presence of all status effects being more dangeroes, while the armor itself grants elemental protection. Then, there is the design of Chaos Cloak and greater alchemy tree, which will be discussed in proper detail, as we cover the timeline.

#### Spirit Mother's Realm

Spirit Mother is the assumed to be a benevolent deity, representing nature in general terms:

- `I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress. Finding and freeing it may prove useful` ([Nameless Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless))).
- `Does your guild better commune with the Spirit Mother in her faraway realm?` ([Decorate your Guild Hall with the splendors of Almire!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102786)).
- `... a force of nature summoned to this realm to extinguish the unnatural fire that is consuming it. ... Now none may proceed beyond the court as columns of shadow fire block all exits. Shadow fire can only be extinguished with the water that flows from these spirit wells. The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself` ([Firestorm Citadel - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite)).

As Spirit Mother's presence is felt only in relation to Almire, her existence, as a remote deity-like supernatural figure, is only characterized by her relation to the kingdom of Almire.

We will keep her existence in mind, despite her seeming lack of presence outside of the kingdom. We will discuss those questions with the presented background information in the [analysis of Almire and Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother).

#### The Void: Part 1

The void as a word is mentioned in a few contexts:

- The names of [Swarm-related entities](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Swarm) -- when auto-target is enabled they are described as Void enemies, including the [Void Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Void_Soul) during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares).
- By [a speaker of the Echo Stone of Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone#Echo_Stone): `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER`.
- By professor [Allister Danford in his journal entry regarding Apocrea](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276): `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness`.

Those three variations of the term "void" require further and greater elaboration. But as of currently, we are concerned with the simplest compared to the rest of cases -- mentions of the void for Void monsters of the Swarm depths by knight's auto-target HUD feature.

##### Knight's HUD

The reason for it being the source of information on the canonicity of enemy naming convention -- it is a smaller, isolated topic, -- compared to the rest of the above descriptions, as they contain elements charateristic of an _unreliable narrator_, either concealed by metaphors events described in Echo Stones or a journal of driven to madness researcher.

In the case of HUD, we suggest, it must be considered on the same level as other elements of enemy identification system, being their type, health, and weakness. While the _default animation of any opened menu_ may be considered an in-universe method of those options being observed, a stronger argument lies in characters' acknowledgement of the rest of enemies' properties.

Knight's auto target of enemies shows their names, monster family and health. For the monster families specifically we come from an idea that classification is developed by Spiral Order biotechs in the same format as it is presented by [Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn). Hahn, being Chief Biotech by the time of [Best of the Beast](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Best_of_the_Beast) rank mission, has throughoutly analyzed [monster families and corresponding damage types](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn#Dialogue). Given this correspondence, the naming scheme of enemies is one we can rely on as most likely defined by Spiral Order.

Aforementioned identification allows to position the void as a tangible concept, despite its currently unknown nature and relation to the observed with the Swarm enemies.

##### Swarm

As for the Swarm itself, presence of the void in relation to its existence apart from enemy naming convention is found in an ongoing narrative told by Echo Stones:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. ... WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU. ... USE WHAT IS HERE TO PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE TO COME. IT KNOWS OF YOU NOW. IT WILL FIND A WAY OUT AND COME FOR YOU` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_stones#Echo_Stone)).
- `AS I DREAMED, IT CONSUMED. IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED. IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE. WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL. IT IS... THE SWARM` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_stones#Echo_Stone)).

Given this data, we believe the Swarm may be understood, despite its eldritch, _not meant to be known nature_, through development of __a conceptual framework, a system and a set of laws, by which this cosmology operates__.

#### Energy

There exists power, contained within [Sparks of Life](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_of_life#Spark_of_Life), capable of reviving recently deceased Knights. Sparks of Life become available on knight's second knockout, and differ from an initial emergency revive by giving _temporary increase to Knight's damage output_, accompanied by _a lightning strike_ of particular color and _rumble across Clockworks' depth_, as seen by specs of dust falling as the knight revives, indicating -- as far as the theme of energy suggest, -- a temporary surge of power.

It can be argued that emergency revive, at its base, is not the Spark of Life itself, but a related mechanism, as one provided by the equipment and capable of being recharged when passing through the depths. As stated:

- `All knights now have an Emergency Revive mechanism built into their armor that will revive them shortly after falling in combat once per floor. An ER only restores all the red health pips you have, but no more` ([Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)).
- `Energy is a very special power that is constantly emanating from the core of this world. It is totally stable and will never be lost unless traded or spent. (You can see how much energy you have on the energy module in your arsenal)` ([Energetic Knight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Energetic_Knight_Dialogue/Town_Square)).
- `Shortly after the Spiral Knights landed upon Cradle, scouting teams reported an intense energy signal coming from the planet’s core, and now the Knights have been tasked with investigating in the hopes that this energy can be used to power their ship. The Clockworks and most every machine the knights encounter run on energy, including their own power armor. All knight armor is equipped with a device that is able to constantly pull energy from the air; known as ‘mist,’ into their armor, allowing them to function and power up machinery they encounter. However, mist dissipates almost as quickly as it is acquired, and thus a knight’s mist energy can never be permanently stored. However, the Strangers that run Haven have long been mining various parts of the Clockworks for pure, crystallized energy and like everything in their possession, it is for sale. This crystallized energy is much more stable and can last forever in a knights reserve tank, inside their armor ... Due to the intense power source at Cradle's core, the entire planet's atmosphere is imbued with loose, airborne mist energy ... Each Spiral Knight will constantly absorb this mist energy ... The Strangers operate an elaborate mining system in order to retrieve and harness the crystallized energy that occurs at great depths, beneath the planet's crust` ([Crystal Energy - Lore - Cory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Energy&oldid=20)).

It must be kept in mind that emergency revive mechanic and Sparks of Life were introduced later with unification of crystal and mist energy: `Mist energy and mist tank items have been removed. Player-owned mist tanks have been replaced with 10 Sparks of Life (bound). Player-owned mini mist tanks have been replaced with 1 Spark of Life (bound) ‘Crystal Energy’ is now simply called ‘Energy’. Mist Wells have been renamed 'Energy Wells' and no longer provide a 25% bonus on deposit. Mist within Mist Wells has been converted to energy and may be withdrawn at 100 energy per day` ([Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)).

While we _acknowledge existence of both Crystal and Mist energy_, we will follow along the paradigm of a current unified medium of energy, but reintroduce the prior, wherein we believe it can explain potential ambiguities of yet established physical laws.

Spark of Life represent a type of energy, which is characterized by the _light-blue color and a rectangular pattern_. That same energy is observed at Clockworks elevators on their activation, as this behavior is left from the earlier period of energy mechanics, when elevators had required mist energy to operate and transition depths. But the fact itself of energy used to power them -- visually, -- remains, and will be kept track of as an important component to how Clockworks operate as an artificial construct (`Elevators no longer require any energy to operate. Explore the Clockworks as much and as often as you wish!` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)), and, evidently, a megastructure.

##### Other forms of energy

Apart from crystl and mist energy abstraction there are other forms of energy, which affect living and non-living matter:

- Minerals are capable of depletion: `No more depleted Crimsonite here` ([Deadly Shard Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Shard_Bomb)).
- There are [fuming trojans of tier 3](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan) and [Arkus's burning shard after the first revive, followed by purple lightning arcs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus). In relation to trojans in general, those crystals resemble the most dark matterr mineral with a semi-unique propery of burning with pink flames. Those minerals were connected to the activity of Clockworks, notably, [gate construction](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gate_construction), which is later explored in the [tortodrones section](#anatomy-of-tortodrone-and-crimsonite) and [Minerals and Souls relation section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).
- Existence of [the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact), which is connected to the Core through the Consoles _located behind throne rooms of Royal Jelly Palace and Firestorm Citatel_. The Artifact is capable of powering Spiral Order field facilities, as seen during and after the events of [The Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator): `If you can restore power to the camp, the Spiral Knights can power their turrets and create a defensive perimeter. Once secure, it may be possible to reconnect with Spiral HQ` at the Rescue Camp.

    The Artifact is also known to be capable of being charged by gremlin technology. We will not go into greater detail, as now we only indend to outline the main principles and notable qualities:

    - `Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` ([Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). We should note, based on general motivation of Herex, his name, and lack of any other candidates, all information modules signed as `-H` are written by Herex. The energy facility of [Restoring the Power](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator/Restoring_Power) has all the same gremlin technology, the wires that lead up the platform with [the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact).
    - `I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion` ([Shadowplay - throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)).

- Tearium, the fuel of the main Skylark generator, or likely, reactor, is measured in tons: `After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source. Since so far we haven't found several hundred tons of tearium just lying around, the bird has effectively lost its wings` ([Reporting for Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue)).

    As Skylark secondary generator is barely enough to power the Lab - `We managed to pull the secondary generator from the Skylark mostly intact. Unfortunately its barely powerful enough to keep this lab running, let alone power our ship. We'll need to find another power source if we ever hope to return home` ([Haven - Lab - Biotech]()), - we can start to outline technological level of Spiral Order.

- Found across Clockworks, [Fire Crystals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_crystal#Fire_Crystal), and specifically, radiant fire crystals do contain a form of energy and heat: `The heat within is wild and mysterious, shining brighter than any natural fire` ([Radiant Fire Crystal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_crystal#Radiant_Fire_Crystal)).

##### Battle Sprites' energy signature

And then there is the phenomenon of transformed battle sprites seen during the rescue missions of [A Revelation in Flames](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames), [Angels from Antiquity](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity), and [The Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask), involving [Drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon), [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx), and [Maskeraith](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith) battle sprites. This is not a regular observation within known by Spiral Order metaphysics, as suggested by Rhedon: `The energy signature I'm detecting is erratic, but still definitely a battle sprite. They may be in trouble, so let's hurry! ... Something has happened to them, they've changed into some kind of creature. ... They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know` ([Sunset Steppes - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes)).

Morlin in that regard suggests: `Though their cellular identity is still wholly that of a battle sprite. My hypothesis is that somehow they rapidly evolved to survive in their new environment` ([A Revelation in Flames/The Lab - Morlin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/The_Lab)).

Given the early stage the narrative and setting of Cradle were unfolding, we suggest that this arc of battle sprites' discovery is meant to introduce multiple aspects of Cradle's nature apart from specifically gameplay aspect of a sprite. As it had served to introduce Camp Crimson and other facets of gremlin civilization, the idea of `erratic` energy signatures of battle sprites in particular resembles the description of energy of the Core: `we discovered that within the heart of this rock resonates a power signature of unprecedented magnitude` ([Reporting for Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue)).

As at current point there is no other as clearly distinct source of sudden transformation across Cradle _with a motif of excess energy_, we will propose that nature of Cradle is responsible for the present metamorphosis.

With this, we introduce a potential phenomenon of __energy capable of transforming living organisms__, which is dependant on currently unknown metaphysics of energy (`the entire planet's atmosphere is imbued with loose, airborne mist energy` - [Crystal Energy - Lore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Energy&oldid=20)).

Weather this proposal as well as the prior categories of energy could be traced back to a universal medium, one potentially represented by the designs of the internal volume within the Core or the rectangular patterns, or, a potentially unseen medium, remains an open question.

##### Environment of the Core, Whitespace

In order to characterize descrete locations and associated items, we now will propose a term for the designs and environments within the Core, as observed during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares), namely, the monochrome environemnt which takes form of mostly featureless cubes of varying size, phasing in and out of existence, and capable of forming pathways across internal volume of the Core, gates and mineral-like keys.

For proper distinction we will define this environemnt as the _Whitespace -- a volume within the Core and the matter identifed by its unique shape, color and texture_. The Core will be referencing the encompassing structure observed from the outlook point of the Core Terminal.

##### Spiral Order and introduction to Alchemy

Based on [Kora's dialogue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Welcome_to_Haven!#Dialogue): `Lastly I need to get you up to speed on something called 'energy.' its very important to your mission here on Cradle` ([Welcome to Haven](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Welcome_to_Haven)), it can be argued that the concept of energy might be unique to Cradle, but based on presence of energy symbol across Spiral Order equipment, _such as turrets and handguns_, it might be rather a case of those _developments existing prior to discovery of Cradle_, as this machinery most likely came from Skylark since those [devices were deployed](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mecha_Turret) as early as the first night in the current version of the [Resque Camp](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rescue_camp).

That could be a plausible explanation, albeit one which does not yet conflict with established Spiral Order considering it being a military organization, and, by extension, yet to be discussed civilization, exists in the context of an existential war with Morai. And then both have managed to exist for _a long period of time_, as suggested by the [Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit): `This suit was once worn by Isoran starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations`.

Given this context, concept of energy seems to be adjusted and incorporated into their designs and culture before being introduced to Cradle. As far as this argument goes, it requires further elaboration, while here it is mostly meant to outline the general relation knights have with energy.

##### Introduction of Special Damage Types

As for the military organization of Spiral Order itself, it is worth noting a particular method new information on special demage types is introduced, specifically, based on the rank or position in the order:

- `Now that you are undertaking missions in 'Tier 2' of the Clockworks, monsters will begin inflicting special damage types that you need to be aware of and prepare for or else you could face certain doom! One of our lead Biotechs, Hahn, has prepared a brief lesson on piercing monsters. Speak with him via com link before taking on any further missions` ([Pierce of Cake](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pierce_of_Cake)).
- `Hello there, ... Spiral HQ has informed me that you will be needing a quick lesson in the species of monsters within the Clockworks that inflict piercing damage, yes?` ([Pierce of Cake - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pierce_of_Cake)).
- `It seems the closer monsters get to the Core, the more their unique properties begin to surface. In most cases this takes the form of their being able to inflict special damage types that require special defenses in order to withstand properly. In Tier 2, a monster inflicting a special damage type will always produce a split normal/special damage output. Thus, normal defense is still a somewhat valid defense choice` ([Pierce of Cake - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pierce_of_Cake)).

The idea that biotechs are aware of those damage types -- shadow, elemental, and specifically piercing damage, as it is found in [cobalt line of armors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor), -- have a capacity to be called speial, makes them by definition as such, special in relation to other damage, which is considered normal.

##### Emptied Energy Symbol

Noting here, energy is also utilized by knights in 2 more areas across Clockworks proper:

- Powering dormant constructs through transfer of energy.
- Skylark's secondary reactor, one located in the Haven's Lab has same light-blue glow to it, as energy. Construction and design of the reactor and the Arcade gate pillars is practically the same, although this could be a case of asset optimization, taken game's scope.

The symbol of energy used by the Spiral Order has 2 elements to it, in detail observed in 3 instances:

- [Energy well](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Energy_Well) in Guild Hall has all attributes of energy, the glow, the patterns, and the symbol. What is important is the state of a well, when it contains no energy: the symbol of energy is rotated so that its middle horizontal line becomes vertical, and the symbol itself changes color to darker red.
- The knight's energy counter, when it reaches 0, becomes __dark red__.
- The [auto turrets](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mecha_Turret#Auto_Turret) of Spiral Order, when they are deactivated, have the same, __positioned vertically and red energy symbol__.

We will refer to this variation of energy symbol as _inverted_ for the consistency of our terminology.

#### Introduction of Alchemy

Here, we would assess a potential link of energy -- as a universal or close to one, medium, -- and Spiral Order to alchemy through energy's currently recognized application and references, such as the above [design of lack of energy](#emptied-energy-symbol).

As energy is tied to the act of transmutation in alchemy machines, it is worth noting the text where alchemy was introduced proper: [Alchemy for Beginners](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners) mission description and dialogue:

- `Alchemy is a craft mastered by the Spiral Knights that allows for the inherent powers of various materials to awaken and fuse with each other in order to form powerful, new items! The Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries` ([Alchemy for Beginners](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners)).
- `It's pretty simple stuff really, thanks to these Alchemy Stations. They do all the heavy lifting for ya! That's because every time you transmute an item through alchemy, there is a chance you can get one of several Unique Variants that makes your item much more powerful!` ([Alchemy for Beginners - Bosco](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners#Dialogue)).

Those descriptions _initially imply that Alchemy stations are built by civilization_ to which Spiral Order biologically belongs. The knownledge of alchemy is deep enough to incorporate it, as energy for powering the weaponry, for military use for members of Spiral Order.

Yet, as there is a variability in the form of _Unique Variants_, this process may be not completely understood or due to inherent nature of alchemy, in order to maximize efficiency of weapons, -- and the effiency of those Unique Variants, which are labeled by Spiral Order as such. Amplified properties identified as the unique variants are significant enough to try to attain them.

In regards to unknown potentioal of alchemy, there is a [Mysterious Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mysterious_Alchemy_Machine), which is on itself a massive topic of discussion, given its contents, design and context. We will keep this idea of source of alchemy on Cradle for further discussion, but for now current introduction will suffice.

##### Reconstruction of Alchemy

Referencing the description of [Alchemy for Beginners](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners): `Alchemy is a craft mastered by the Spiral Knights that allows for the inherent powers of various materials to awaken and fuse with each other in order to form powerful, new items! The Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries`, the term of `inherent power` will be kept track of, as it offers the foundation for _this Universe's version of alchemy as a tool_, as well suggests a set of symbolic, supernatual, or metaphysical principles for this reality to accommodate for a scope of the select, currently unidefined alchemical concepts, as ones having a foundation in Spiral Knights' metaphysics, rather than being a precursor to chemistry as it is in the present reality.

We will consider this in-universe concept of alchemy as one inspired by real-world many western and eastern interpretations of alchemy, while preserving the core goals of alchemy independent of the setting, even a futuristic one. The existence of many conflicting interpretations of alchemy and nature of those is also one inherent property we should keep in mind:

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

  Alchemy, as is well known, describes a process of chemical transformation and gives numberless directions for its accomplishment. Although hardly two authors are of the same opinion regarding the exact course of the process and the sequence of its stages, the majority are agreed on the principal points at issue, and have been so from the earliest times, i.e., since the beginning of the Christian era.

  The alchemical opus deals in the main not just with chemical experiments as such, but with something resembling psychic processes expressed in pseudochemical language. The ancients knew more or less what chemical processes were; therefore they must have known that the thing they practised was, to say the least of it, no ordinary chemistry.

  If the alchemist is admittedly using the chemical process only symbolically, then why does he work in a laboratory with crucibles and alembics? And if, as he constantly asserts, he is describing chemical processes, why distort them past recognition with his mythological symbolisms?

  This puzzle has proved something of a headache to many an honest and well-meaning student of alchemy. On the one hand the alchemist declares that he is concealing the truth intentionally, so as to prevent wicked or stupid people from gaining possession of the gold and thus precipitating a catastrophe. But, on the other hand, the same author will assure us that the gold he is seeking is not—as the stupid suppose—the ordinary gold (aurum vulgi), it is the philosophical gold or even the marvellous stone, the lapis invisibilitatis (the stone of invisibility), or the lapis aethereus (the ethereal stone), or finally the unimaginable hermaphroditic rebis, and he will end up by saying that all recipes whatsoever are to be despised.

  ...

  The real nature of matter was unknown to the alchemist: he knew it only in hints. In seeking to explore it he projected the unconscious into the darkness of matter in order to illuminate it. In order to explain the mystery of matter he projected yet another mystery — his own unknown psychic background — into what was to be explained: Obscurum per obscurius, ignotum per ignotius! This procedure was not, of course, intentional; it was an involuntary occurrence.

</BookCitation>

This introduces a notion of Spiral Order's alchemy _being a studied and semi-predictable phenomenon_, an inversion of its real-world counterpart, now used _to consistently procude utilities_, primarily weapons.

With this taken in consideration, as well as familiarity of Spiral Order with the process of transmutaion weather or not it uses Orbs of Alchemy, we can make a guess that Spiral Order is familiar to alchemy on the same level, as energy, both being __not novel concepts to their civilization__.

While we did hint at a conflicting existence of Alchemy Stations across Clockworks, ending in the [Sanctuary Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sanctuary_Alchemy_Machine) with its compound design, we will not yet discuss those elemnts now, only acknowledging their existence on Cradle.

#### Energy of the Core

Meanwhile, as its is implied that the Core itself is the energy source, a suggestion could be made that it is the space within the Core either [Whitespace](#environment-of-the-core-whitespace) itself or unknown location hidden within the Core is the precise source, from which energy is supplied and then distributed across Clockworks through the boundary of the Core. This approach leverages the potential of _Clockworks as a planet-scale megastructure_ with its multifaceted complexity as a machine requiring maintanance and fuel.

The fact that the knights contribute energy to elevators in its required amount, while Spiral Order is not native to Cradle, makes energy seem as more of a universal resource.

By that we suggest that Spiral Order and gremlin technology such as [mecha knights](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mecha_Knight#Mecha_Knight_Kit) and in lesser manner elevators -- as creations of a different civilization, -- would initially seem not to be able to cooperate on the same if not more advanced resource, they do.

This approach evidently disregards the out-of-iniverrse purpose to provide gameplay elements to Clockworks, we operate in terms of this universe existing through those mechanics.

Such interoperability of energy creates a precedent where it is neither strictly gremlin nor Spiral Order technology, __but a universal property, into which both civilization can tap into though their respective interfaces__.

And if energy in its depiction is a universal property, Whitespace, as the candidate for source of energy from the Core, becomes either an interface to operate with nature of energy, or is its source. In both instances, contents of the Core provide means for energy to be delivered from the Core.

As access to the Core is a significant element of lategame narrative, as Core's access is secured _even without involvement of the Sleeper and Echo Stones_, in a similar manner to [Energy Wells](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Energy_Well), we have a large area of symbolic meaning and motifs to explore regarding containment of energy both for Spiral Order and Clockworks.

Those properties exist in the context of energy being a scarce resource _now presented in excess amount_ through introduction of Cradle -- a narrative on its own, -- which allows us to observe this aspect of handling, manipulation and accumulation of energy without significant resource-driven limitations.

#### Dragons

In relation to the general cosmology, there are dragons and 3 elemnts not seen in the game itself:

- The [Riders' Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle#Rider_Mantle) refer to 3 gods using their elements -- storms, rage and frenzy, -- to `carve worlds from stone`:

    - `A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god who used lightning to carve whole worlds from stone` ([Storm Rider Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Rider_Mantle#Storm_Rider_Mantle)).
    - `A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god who used rage to carve whole worlds from stone` ([Raging Rider Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Rider_Mantle#Raging_Rider_Mantle)).
    - `A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god who used frenzy to carve whole worlds from stone` ([Frenzy Rider Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Rider_Mantle#Frenzy_Rider_Mantle)).

    Those powers of storms, rage, and frenzy are shown in mythological framing to cause large scale changes, when applied.

- Multiple [Dragon Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm) refer to beasts, implied to be dragons based on the equipment name. Those creatures were also related to element of storm, rage, and frenzy.

    In passing of those beasts worlds were created, with exception of rage element, which came to be disastrous -- `beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` ([Raging Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm)) -- a very specific choice to words, compared to other 2 descriptions:

    - `created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` ([Storm Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm)).
    - `shaped the world in its passing: its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` ([Frenzy Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm)).

    Yet, in the context of other items, all three steps seemingly are required to create or shape the world. It is worth noting that we are not yet aware of the scope of the world described.

Can it be proven that these were in fact dragons and not a metaphor of "dragons?" We propose that __transformed Battle Sprites are essential__ to resolving many questions with _such degree of ambiguity in relation to unseen actors and shaping of greater world outside of the setting of Cradle_.

We know that Spiral Order knew how dragons look based on Rhedon's quote: `They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons` ([A Revelation in Flames - Sunset Steppes - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes)).

Due to an unidentified relation between dragons and Spiral Order, but though the presence of dragon scales in Azure Guardian armor -- `A noble helmet reserved for the most senior members of the Spiral Order. The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret` ([Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm)), -- the naming of Drakon here only affirms Spiral Order's _observation of them as reminiscent of dragons_, which by proxy suggests a general appearance of the latter, as close if not identical to a dragon, apart from, potentially, creature's size.

We propose that 3 sub-species of Drakons suggest existence of divine, shadow and rage dragons, which if mapped onto earlier elements of storm, frenzy and rage, would plausibly fit to descriptions of implied dragon beasts, referred in the [Dragon Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm).

We match 3 sub-species of Drakon battle sprites to 3 elements, established earlier. There are 3 variants of Drakon: [red Drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon), [divine Drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)), [shadow Drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Shadow)). They suggest existence of divine and shadow aspects to their evolution if we extrapolate on Morlin's explanation: `Though their cellular identity is still wholly that of a battle sprite. My hypothesis is that somehow they rapidly evolved to survive in their new environment` ([A Revelation in Flames - The Lab - Morlin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/The_Lab)).

While [divine drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)) can be attributed to an element of storms, and [shadow drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Shadow)) to frenzy, the _commmon Drakon is not attributed to any of those element_.

Yet, there are a two hints, which would allow us to identify common red drakon as a rage drakon:

- `The Drakon is a battle sprite that embodies fiery destruction. Its skills focus on raw, offensive power` ([Drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon)).

  This drakon is the most common depiction of dragon, as other 2 variants are unlikely to be obtained from the start, so the way Spiral Order refers to Drakon would be characteristic of a connection to rage until other sub-families of drakon would be discovered.

- Color red, given presence of other elemnts and corresponding armors ties only to red plates of rage-infused armors: `beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` ([Raging Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm)):

  The skillset of drakon allows for further connection with motifs of destruction, particularly the [Firestorm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm): `Summon the power of true dragon fire to burn everything in your path`. It is also here a term of `true dragon` is found, implying a direct connection with creatures called dragons and attributed to them power capable of destruction.

This naming convention in relation to dragons, drakon sprites, the modern special damage types, we believe, are connected by being different interpretations of fundamental mythic forces -- the antique conventions presenting them as frenzy, rage and storms, followed by a modern naming convention directed by Spiral Order, as normal, shadow and elemental or piercing. This results in a parity of _shadow damage to frenzy_ and _normal damage to rage_.

The last element observed as attributed to storm, we will look closer at, as it has a few of its symbolic elemnts not matching with modern counterparts:

- Storms have a relation to the skies as manifestation of, colloqually, divine presence, which itself ties to all of above armors, but not to elemental damage;
- Elemental damage can be seen as aspect of storms through inclusion of shock status effect as lightnings. Elemental damage is found in application of elements of ice, earth, shock, or fire across the status effects, being the closest to presence of magic to the point of being referred as such: `An exceptional handgun that fires powerful, elemental shots that many Spiral Knights refer to as 'magic missiles'` ([Arcana](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana)). Magic itself is found in many variations in the latter context of Owlites, including shock;
- As piercing damage being used to damage monsters of fiend family, _framing it as holy damage_, it does not possess a visual reference to storms, but has _color of its weapons close to one of storm-themed armors and of divine drakon_.

It seems to us as if elemental and piercing damage of Spiral Order is a result of _strategic, functional, cognitive and thematic_ distinction, attributed only to modern world and their civilizations' partial understanding of those elements' metaphysics.

As for now, we won't commit to any of those parities of storm element, we have established this network of connections __between divinity, stroms and inherent power of natural elements, hence elemental__.

###### Introduction of Harnesses and Crystalls

There are also [harnesses](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Harness), which allow to pair their composition -- of darkness, crystalls and gold, -- to, initially, shadow, elemental, pierecing damage, and then darkness to frenzy fitting with the designs of frenzy armors, _crystalls to elemental damage_, and _gold as characteristic of piercing damage_.

As normal damage is identified by iron harness, there might exits a connection between rage and iron, -- for this we will keep track of other peculiar appearances of iron as a symbol, as well as emerging meaning and application of crystalls.

Then there are crystalls. Crystalls, as, most likely, minerals across Clockworks, attain themes and motif of those minerals and ideas they represent. Specifically in the context of this elemental-piercing relation to storms and divinity, the design of gold keys within the Whitespace is strikingly different, as the _keys there are gold or luminite crystalls_. As if their all-encompassing nature, similar to elemental damage, went beyond status effects and had found itself both in darkness or frenzy -- as dark matter (`A fabled mineral dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness` - [Dark Matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter)) -- and, potentially, in divinity, as luminite outside of Whitespace designs (`A fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it` - [Luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Luminite#Luminite)), and, much later in the analysis of Whitespace and Sleeper, in divinity, which is itself a common theme of items crafted with [Light Shards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Light_Shard).

Those combinations of meanings and symbols, we propose, open up a possibility of natural connection, __as if the elements of frenzy, storms, and rage came from a different culture__, a _pagan interpretation of primordial forces from a different time_, distinct yet similar to modern definitions.

##### Dragon Scales

The description `its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` ([Frenzy Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm)) introduces scales that are [Dragon Scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale) -- a material, for a fact belonging to a dragon: `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature. It reflects light with an otherworldly sheen` ([Dragon Scale](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale)). The `otherworldly sheen` further suggests an elevated state of being of dragons.

Now it is a question of belonging of those scales either to shadow sub-species of dragons, based on the fact it is mentioned for frenzy dragons, or those scales could belong to an entire species of dragons, as those scales, an item, seemingly lack elemental classification but a few of items crafted with scales have piercing defence.

Those scales could relate to Underworld or to general supernatural aspect by the fact of usage of word `otherworldly`. But, at the same time, items crafted from that material are not restricted to shadow-related damage and defense only, as well as existence of [Divine Drakons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)) suggests a nature, thematically different from the Underworld, so the scales could belong to any sub-species of dragons - which will be our current reasoning, while affirming their extra-natural status without aligning them to any specific realm.

The rage and normal damage thematic parity is also seen in [tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone): `handgun empowered by the limitless fury of a tortodrone. While wielding it you can feel the berserk energy within eager to be unleashed` ([Grand Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist)). Tortofist deals pure normal damage, yet possesses lighning on par with other finalized tortodrone equipment. Tortodrones themselves are associated with rage not only by their equipment and design of cosmetics, but the design of an [enraged tortodrone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)) of missions card.

While corrupted (`A handgun alchemized from the shell of a corrupted tortodrone` - [Grim Buster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Buster)) tortodrones are fought in [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Call_of_the_Colossi). The colossi in depth's name, due to tortodrones' presence and size, we suggest, _are referring to tortodrones_. They still deal normal and elemental damage, despite their corrupted weaponry likely being [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist), as it is a shadow damage weapon. So far, we will not delve into the specifics of Tortodrones, as they will be revisited in a [later section](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), where this motif will be explored in greater depth.

Due to this we propose that:

- Drakon battle sprites are meant to immitate dragons, both are categorized into sub-species associated with damage types of **storm/divinity/elemental damage**, **rage/normal damage**, and **frenzy/shadow damage**.
- Primordial forces of storms, rage and frenzy are present in modern times and are rediscovered by different civilizations, who label them in their own understanding of the world.
- Dragons carry fundamental properties of the world. They potentially exist across multiple realms or their habitat is not restricted to a singular celestial body.

  this feature will be revisited and dissected in relation to Spiral Order in the [Old Order Knights of Isora section](#establishment-of-order), -- that Spiral Order is aware of dragons and had their own experiences with them, while it is Cradle of all places which has large amounts of draconic imagery and designs, specifically, across castles and [other set, or strate, of ruins](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland).

#### Creation Myth, Dragons as Cosmic Progenitors

Dragons are connected to the creation myth. From the introduction of dragons in [Dragon Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm), we derive an understanding that dragons are responsible for shaping of an abstract world through acts of creation, shaping and razing. Those steps were recorded by a civilization which had witnesses those events first-hand, as the description frames them, in order to immitate their anatomy into equipment:

- `visage of beast who some believe created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` ([Storm Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm))
- `visage of beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` ([Raging Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm))
- `visage of beast who some believe shaped the world in its passing: its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` ([Frenzy Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm))

Considering many other instances of world being changed and manipulated with, such as spirits returning to material realm, Kataclysm, and general theming of those, the described acts of widescale change by deific entities are highly probable. And, given the framing of a creation myth, the power weilded by those gragons must have been most immense, as power to influnce the world varies across existing species such as [Spookats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spookat#Spookat), [Black Kats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spookat#Black_Kat), [Grimalkin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spookat#Grimalkin), and reaching its observed highest capacity during summoning of [Margrel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel).

Dragons' lifespan is unknown, but as [dragon scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale) are present and are capable of withstanding effects of time, while still being used in 5-star alchemy by Spiral Order, we may derive both anatomical and symbolic role from those facts. As bones, dragon scales may be everlasting, as the prior are a common across many cultures depictionion of death due to their timelessness relative to other components of a living being, they are also bones -- the foundation -- of the world: - `visage of beast who some believe created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` ([Storm Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm)).

There could be only 3 dragon-deities, each representing their element, which would also fit and explin the physical nature of the myth, elevating those dragons above other dragons. As if _entire nature of those dragons was used to fuel or manifest a world into existence_, as the elements of dragons' anatomy through their deific existence became symbols and source for manifested concepts of the existence. This is the most distinct creation myth as other real-world instances:

- In Norse mythology the creation myth revolves around a defeated giant named Ymir, whose components -- _flesh, blood and bones, -- become land, seas, and hills_.

  The transition of bones to mountains is one we will keep track of as it is not the only instance of North mythology being used, but also a guidepost towards other symbolic relations united under North mythology, its characters and plots.

- In Hindu mythology, there are _three fundamental forces_, embodied by Lord Brahma -- the Creator, and the force of creation; Lord Vishnu -- the Preserver and the force of preservation; and Lord Shiva -- the destroyer and an embodyment of the forces of darkness and destruction.

    This composition of creation followed by maintanance followed by destruction while not identically, is found in dragons' acts of creation, shaping, and destuction. The act of shaping does not align with the force of preservation in particular, but its general pattern may be recognized from a differnt perspective -- where distinct shape is an alias for stabilization, -- a world taking its finite form, which announces its long-term physical cohesion.

- In Chinese mythology, creator Pangu had separated Yin and Yang. The Yin became the Earth and the Yang became the Heavens. Pangu's body was transformed after this separation, and _his breath became the wind and clouds, while his voice became the sound of thunder_.
- The Mesopotamian epic -- `The Battle between Marduk and Tiamat`, and the Babylonian creation myth -- `Enuma Elish`, provide a similar idea.

  Goddess Tiamat is associated with the primordial chaos and sea, but only later she is described as a serpent. She was defeated by Marduk, the god of thunderstorms. After her defeat, _her body was split by Marduk in two halves. From them, heavens and earth were created_ -- another creation myth.

  The interpretation of Goddess Tiamat as a dragon was a later development, but it is one interpretation that has settled in popular culture, specifically in the universe of "Dungeons and Dragons". While it is not particularly important development, it is known that some inspiration from existing fictional works was present in some capacity, initially taken as inspiration, later developed and build upon: `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right` ([10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773)). It is also in relation to the cosmogony of Elder Scrolls, dragons are considered primordial entities, responsible for the existence and form of its universe, which may be the other, more plausible, candidate for the proposed worldbuilding.

Those implications of dragons' lifespan, or at least longevity of their armor are also hinted at in `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature` ([Dragon Scale](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale)), as dragons from the perspective and knowledge of the world of Spiral Order were extinct -- as if dragons are found on Cradle. We do not have a visual evidence of dragons' presence on Cradle.

As we do not have any other examples of a world being created by such means, which would suggest it being a myth with consideration of plausibility of powers seen across the Clockworks, we can consider several interpretations:

- If dragons did create the worlds in their passing, this would seem as if their existence is not one of as generally understood lifecycle of species, existing in a different understanding of the word, - as a part of the process of Universe taking its form in a distinct sequence of change from nothing to something.

    Dragons being extinct after this would be interpreted as a myth of their disappearance -- a creature powerful enough, -- so that it would not be present in a world born of their passing.

- If we consider dragons immortal and deific entities, and them being potentially alive to the present-day Cradle, implies that some external force would be present far in the past that had caused dragons' extinction as the violent or conflict-driven narrative is not novel in the total of creation myths across human culture. This force should be powerful enough to defeat beasts implied to be wielding powers of storms, rage and frenzy, as suggested by riders' mantles.

    Here, [Riders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) in that regard could be either literal riders of dragons, or riders of the metaphorical forces. In this case, for now, the latter interpretation seems fitting, due to riders' status as gods, capable `to carve whole worlds from stone` ([Rider Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle)).

    In other words, _existence of an ancient conflict_, which had led to death of dragons would explain their absence and allow for their death to be an organic component of the sequence which eventually became the creation myth, as dragons' deaths were of the same symbolic nature as human deities' bodies becoming foundations of the world.

#### Lesser Creaton Myth

This latest idea of a conflict which had led to dissaapearance of dragons had led us to the analysis of the Riders. Apart from the creation myth involving dragons, there is a different sequence attributed to Riders:

- `A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god who used lightning to carve whole worlds from stone` ([Storm Rider Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Rider_Mantle#Storm_Rider_Mantle)).
- `A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god who used frenzy to carve whole worlds from stone` ([Frenzy Rider Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Rider_Mantle#Frenzy_Rider_Mantle)).
- `A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god who used rage to carve whole worlds from stone` ([Raging Rider Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Rider_Mantle#Raging_Rider_Mantle)).

Compared to the sequence of dragons perishing, the gods, whom those armors are attributed to, do not include a destructive action nor armors' description form a cohesive order of world creation, but rather all of three god had utilized their respective elements `to carve whole worlds from stone`. The identities of those worlds are unknown, as well as the species of the riders mey not yet be attributed to any known civilization in particular.

Yet, we can make a few initial suggestions. As dragon helms are created after dragons of respective elements, some entity, given fantastic nature of this narrative, had to witness those events and create the armor. As those armors of rage, frenzy and storms all possess this quality of an ancient naming convention, we suggest them to be created by that ancient civilization.

Within this context, the direct tie of legendary armor sets to gods of said elemenal powers would closely relate them to this ancient civilization, if the design of armors reflects if not the anatomy adapted for Spiral Order, but design and purpose. The nature of those items is described in the prize boxes -- `Contains various unique costumes and accessories crafted from thunder and lightning` ([Frenzy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Prize_Box)), which grants them a divine nature associated, in particular, with greek pantheon given the nature of Zeus's and Olympian pantheon's coming to power in a new age.

This motif of lightning apart from already being associatied with the skies, may be develped further in the context of this civilization, who had created those armors.

Taking into consideration the quote -- `Instill in your heart the frenzy of ancient gods!` ([Feel the Frenzy!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/109069)) and presence of the Callers of [storm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Caller#Storm_Caller), [rage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Caller#Rage_Caller) and [frenzy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Caller#Frenzy_Caller) -- we would consider those deities to exist in some capacity up to the modern days of Skylark crash landing on Cradle.

As no proper conection between those gods and dragons is established, we will propose an initial scenarion of the identity of Riders.

As dragons posess properties of raw power, we would associate them to titans of greek mythology, as embodiments of raw semi-magical power. As noted earlier, the bodies of those dragons forming the world is the prime example of the creation myth being established. As for the titans there was a conflict, and as dragons had taken a similar thematic role, we would propose tham to be _slain by deities, which parallel the Olympiam gods_. Whose deities would be ones to be the bearers of Riders' Mantles, given their exclusive characterization.

Given those circumstances, we will label this creation sequence as the _lesser creation myth_.

#### Alchemical Symbolism of a Dragon

As alchemy presents itself as one of particularly important aspects of culture of Spiral Order, we have found a deeply integrated role of dragon in the creation myth.

Both of above interpretations of specific role of dragons reveal a narrative of them emboding fundamental principles or forces of Universe in their, corresponding to alchemical dragon, opposite principles, actions and physiology. The very fact of them being a trinity of semi-opposing characteristics has implications of this pattern being tied symbolically to the _symbol of a dragon in alchemy_:

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

  The dragon in itself is a monstrum - a symbol combining the chthonic principle of the serpent and the aerial principle of the bird. It is, as Ruland says, a variant of Mercurius. But Mercurius is the divine winged Hermes manifest in matter, the god of revelation, lord of thought and sovereign psychopomp. The liquid metal, argentum vivum — “living silver,” quicksilver — was the wonderful substance that perfectly expressed the nature of the στίλβων: that which glistens and animates within. When the alchemist speaks of Mercurius, on the face of it he means quicksilver, but inwardly he means the world-creating spirit concealed or imprisoned in matter. The dragon is probably the oldest pictorial symbol in alchemy of which we have documentary evidence. It appears as the ούρο βόρος, the tail-eater, in the Codex Marcianus, which dates from the tenth or eleventh century, together with the legend: νἓ τò πάν (the One, the All). Time and again the alchemists reiterate that the opus proceeds from the one and leads back to the one, that it is a sort of circle like a dragon biting its own tail. For this reason the opus was often called circulare (circular) or else rota (the wheel). Mercurius stands at the beginning and end of the work: he is the prima materia, the caput corvi, the nigredo; as dragon he devours himself and as dragon he dies, to rise again as the lapis. He is the play of colours in the cauda pavonis and the division into four elements. He is the hermaphrodite that was in the beginning, that splits into the classical brother-sister duality and is reunited in the coniunctio, to appear once again at the end in the radiant form of the lumen novum, the stone. He is metallic yet liquid, matter yet spirit, cold yet fiery, poison and yet healing draught — a symbol uniting all opposites.

  ...

  Antimimos, the imitator and evil principle, appears as the antagonist of the Son of God: he too considers himself to be God’s son. Here the opposites inherent in the deity are clearly divided. We meet this daemon in many other places: he is the spirit of darkness in a man’s body, compelling his soul to fulfil all his sinful tendencies. The alchemical parallel to this polarity is the double nature of Mercurius, which shows itself most clearly in the Uroboros, the dragon that devours, fertilizes, begets, slays, and brings itself to life again. Being hermaphroditic, it is compounded of opposites and is at the same time their uniting symbol: at once deadly poison, basilisk, scorpion, panacea, and saviour.

</BookCitation>

<BookCitation source="Alchemical Studies - Carl Jung">

  Mercurius, following the tradition of Hermes, is many-sided, changeable, and deceitful. Dorn speaks of “that inconstant Mercurius,” and another calls him versipellis (changing his skin, shifty). He is duplex and his main characteristic is duplicity. It is said of him that he “runs round the earth and enjoys equally the company of the good and the wicked.” He is “two dragons,” the “twin,” made of “two natures” or “two substances.” ... The two substances of Mercurius are thought of as dissimilar, sometimes opposed; as the dragon he is “winged and wingless.” A parable says: “On this mountain lies an ever-waking dragon, who is called Pantophthalmos, for he is covered with eyes on both sides of his body, before and behind, and he sleeps with some open and some closed.” There is the “common and the philosophic” Mercurius; he consists of “the dry and earthy, the moist and viscous.” Two of his elements are passive, earth and water, and two active, air and fire. He is both good and evil. The “Aurelia occulta” gives a graphic description of him:

  I am the poison-dripping dragon, who is everywhere and can be cheaply had. That upon which I rest, and that which rests upon me, will be found within me by those who pursue their investigations in accordance with the rules of the Art. My water and fire destroy and put together; from my body you may extract the green lion and the red. But if you do not have exact knowledge of me, you will destroy your five senses with my fire. From my snout there comes a spreading poison that has brought death to many. Therefore you should skilfully separate the coarse from the fine, if you do not wish to suffer utter poverty. I bestow on you the powers of the male and the female, and also those of heaven and of earth. The mysteries of my art must be handled with courage and greatness of mindif you would conquer me by the power of fire, for already very many have come to grief, their riches and labour lost. I am the egg of nature, known only to the wise, who in piety and modesty bring forth from me the microcosm, which was prepared for mankind by Almighty God, but given only to the few, while the many long for it in vain, that they may do good to the poor with my treasure and not fasten their souls to the perishable gold. By the philosophers I am named Mercurius; my spouse is the philosophic gold; I am the old dragon, found everywhere on the globe of the earth, father and mother, young and old, very strong and very weak, death and resurrection, visible and invisible, hard and soft; I descend into the earth and ascend to the heavens, I am the highest and the lowest, the lightest and the heaviest; often the order of nature is reversed in me, as regards colour, number, weight, and measure; I contain the light of nature; I am dark and light; I come forth from heaven and earth; I am known and yet do not exist at all; by virtue of the sun’s rays all colours shine in me, and all metals. I am the carbuncle of the sun, the most noble purified earth, through which you may change copper, iron, tin, and lead into gold.

  ...

  In spite of his obvious duality the unity of Mercurius is also emphasized, especially in his form as the lapis. “In all the world he is One.” The unity of Mercurius is at the same time a trinity, with clear reference to the Holy Trinity, although his triadic nature does not derive from Christian dogma but is of earlier date. Triads occur as early as the treatise of Zosimos, περì ἀρετῆς (Concerning the Art). Martial calls Hermes omnia solus el ter unus (All and Thrice One). In Monakris (Arcadia), a three-headed Hermes was worshipped, and in Gaul there was a three-headed Mercurius. This Gallic god was also a psychopomp. The triadic character is an attribute of the gods of the underworld, as for instance the three-bodied Typhon, three-bodied and three-faced Hecate, and the “ancestors” (τριτοπάτορες) with their serpent bodies. According to Cicero, these latter are the three sons of Zeus the King, the rex antiquissimus. They are called the “forefathers” and are wind-gods; obviously by the same logic the Hopi Indians believe that snakes are at the same time flashes of lightning auguring rain. Khunrath calls Mercurius triunus and ternarius. Mylius represents him as a three-headed snake. The “Aquarium sapientum” says that he is a “triune, universal essence which is named Jehova. He is divine and at the same time human.” From all this one must conclude that Mercurius corresponds not only to Christ, but to the triune divinity in general. The “Aurelia occulta” calls him “Azoth” ...

</BookCitation>

While the idea of god Mercurius is not directly and explicitly present in relation to the establsihed comsology, its symbols, we suggest, are to be found across the narrative, which allow to establish a primarily thematic connection.

But, as of currently, through those symbols, -- the idea of dragons existing and corresponding or embodying 3 fundamnetal elements of the creation myth, -- allows for a potential __alchemical foundation of reality__ _with inclusion of multiple mythologies into its system_.

Given already present themes of alchemy as an _in-unvierse mechanic with an underlying metaphysical principle_ -- the supposed `inherent powers of various materials [to awaken and fuse with each other]` ([Alchemy for Beginners - Bosco](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners#Dialogue)), we will keep this interpretation of the creation myth in mind until further symbolic elements can be identified.

### _Chapter `II` &#160;<br>_ Underworld

Within Underworld fiendish ecosystem develops. Devilites emerge as one of conscious species, and over time develop a society, existing, as currently known, within corporations. One such corporation is named Undercorp and is related to material realm (`Assistant Supervisor of Resource Allocations, Undercorp` -- [Morgral'm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m)) through its presence in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove).

Underworld is not devoid of elements of material realm, identified by common [status effects](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Status_effect). Based on fiendish biology and elemental alignment of devilites, _subdivisions_ are formed within the corporate structure:

- Shock-themed devilites form Undercorp's IT department ([Devil-IT](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite#Devil-IT))
- Freeze-themed Layoafers [Layoafer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite#Layoafer), they are later be trying to establish its own organization at Cradle, separate from Undercorp ([Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral'm)) with Maulos, a trojan, summoned for unknown means
- [Firebranders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firebrander#Firebrander) do use magic in order to form fireballs. Their name suggest a branding with fire of others, alluding to form of branding with a hot iron.

Most of overtimers have unique fiendish weaponry - pitchforks and axes, which have a peculiar property of being made of __stone-like mineral with visible colored cracks in areas of connection with the center being completely removed__. The color aligns with base elemental status effects found across Cradle, apart from curse.

The curse status is absent as well as its imagery related to an eye. Weapons, which do not belong to any status effect have pink color and deal only normal damage. This will be kept in mind for the [intermediate analysis of the curse section](#intermission-analysis-of-curse), as color pink is particularly common across curse-infused materials and equipment. Could it be that the curse is a natural state of existence for Underworld and it is only identified as curse once it enters or intersects with the material realm?

Layoafers and Blarfuls in relation to the rest of corporate hierarchy do not seem to fit in it, rather being outside of it.

#### Dark Cities

Devilite society is developed enough for corporations to exist, and even considered that devilites were from a different intellectual property, they remain in Spiral Knights' cosmology and setting.

It is suggested by Spiral Order that devilites within dark cities are stranded on Cradle: `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld. While how they crossed over and what their motives are on Cradle is unclear, data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us ... The undead on the other hand remain a mystery. Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)).

Devilites being stranded could mean both _spacial and dimensional dislocation_, as they had not, compared to Skylark, arrived to Cradle through interstellar travel, but rather summoned or captured with the cities themselves, if dark cities belong to them.

This state of being stranded can be rephrased as follows:

- Devilites come from a different dimensions, Cradle disallows transition between realms
- Devilites come from material realm, Cradle, through its defences disallows devilites to leave the planet

It is also unknown for now weather metaphysics of Cradle itself is the reason for spirits returning into material realm and devilites being stranded - both cases relating to cross-realm transition between material realm and, likely, Underworld.

Moreover, devilites do continuous research to bring back legion of Ur, so the fact they had to use ritual circles as suggested by [The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur) mission's description -- `an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back`, -- implies that the original method is different, one we will preemptively propose to be of Grim Gates, as it is the only other known method of transportation related to devilite technology, and the only one depicting the devilite corporate hierarchy on its stonework, among other factors later discussed in relation to [Undercorp's presence on Cradle](#grim-gates).

With a high certainty we gather that ritual circles are utilized to summon trojans from the Underworld, as implied by depths' names and their level design: [Plazamonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Plazamonium) is referred in the [The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur) as the `Summoning Circle`, followed by the [`Banishment`](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur#Gate_Map), relating to a popularized idea of entities being summoned _from a dimension metaphysically above or beyond, or, from below_. Most likely, in the case of the Spiral Knights setting, this location is established to be Underworld.

If the cities were excavated and later integrated into Cradle devilites by fact of crossing to material realm should have the technology that would allow them to move back to Underworld, unless it is a one-way operation. The existence of such technology may be affirmed by presence of Grim Gates, which seem to lead to other dark cities as observed by the environment within its active portal.

It is also unknown weather those places -- dark cities' interior, depicted in active Grim Gates portals, -- are located on Cradle or in the Underworld, or weather Grim Gates are rare enough that devilites had to utilize regular summoning circles as in case of events of Legion of Ur, separate from the events of "March of Tortodrones," where those gates are found.

Moreover, it could be the case of Legion of Ur being "sealed," which would potentially forbid Grim Gates from allowing them to pass through. We will analyze and identify those laws of transportation in detail, as for now we group them in order to perceive the scale of Underworld's presence on Cradle.

The narratives of deveilites being stranded, of Legion of Ur being sealed, and of spirits returning to material realm are united in their unknown inception, weather in each case a diffent metaphysical law is present or the Core's influence is responsible for those events.

In [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice), it is stated that city Amu-Sol belongs to devilites - `Freak snowstorms and blizzards have begun surging through the depths seeming to originate from an inhospitable, fiendish city known as 'Amu-Sol'`, and has name similar to the names of [fiendish glyphs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card#Recipe), which are related to grim gates: `Ur`, `Tor`, `Nok`, `Sol`, `Amu`.

Another devilite city -- `Sol' Fork`, -- also shows an already established naming pattern: `After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within. Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins` ([Whipping and Mishandling](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling)).

It is as possible for the city to be of Underworld origin given their name, as much as the names of the cities were given by devilites after they have occupied them.

There was a successful operation of bringing both Maulos and everfrost pillar into Underworld, suggesting that some connection, maybe even to a small degree, remains on Cradle, as [Morgral'm's communications](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m) suggest. How grim gates operate in this context we will analyze closer in [later chapter](#arrival-of-undercorp).

From the standpoint of corporate themes of devilites, those cities seem to be devilites' main habitat. For now, we will _assume the cities to belong to devilites_, rather than any currently undiscovered civilization. _This will be our current assumption_.

#### Influences of Underworld

The notion is of trojans being summoned by devilites, as described in [The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur): `devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors. Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion or Ur', and are said to have once numbered in the thousands. Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back`, must also be viewed in the context of Maulos, as by the fact of him being a trojan, a sequence of events had to happen in order for Maulos to be created -- a unique fiend and a trojan with affinity to everfrost, as far as everfrost being an essential component of trojan's nature, being impaled by it _in place of the supposed dark matter shard_ found among trojans.

Actions of Maulos and his forming cult of devilites is not approved by Undercorp:

- `The entirety of Amu-Sol is swarming with frozen souls and deep within the heart of the city lies the source of it all: the cult's powerful leader, Maulos and a towering column of pure everfrost.` ([Patch Notes: Heart of Ice](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/61137))
- `You are receiving this mail as a result of an incorrect/cryptic entry in your recent resource allocation request` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memos - Morgral'm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgralm))

The operation at Amu-Sol seemingly went in a different direction, as it was not approved by Undercorp at least at that point in time. As far as presence of maulos suggests, the initial activity within Amu-Sol could have been one related to devilites' attempting to bring back Legion of Ur.

While this idea of Maulos being potentially related to the general plot of Legion of Ur, we will return to it later in the detailed analysis of trojans' nature.

As for now, as we make semi-introductory coverage of most Underworld entities, we will point out a particular parallel between Maulos and Lord Vanaduke, as we will find a lot more connection between their narratives:

- Maulos, as a trojan, is different from the rest of Legion of Ur

  - Maulos's unnatural power of frost: `HR has requested an updated org chart as soon as possible. It is our understanding that all Pit Boss duties, administrative and otherwise, have been turned over to a 'Maulos of the Eternal Frost,'` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - 'Fiendish Memo'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol))
  - Source of unnatural frost being related to [everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost): `A small patch of ice crystals that never seem to melt, even when exposed to direct heat`
  - [Blinding Abyss](#blinding-abyss) as the implied location from which Maulos originates, metaphorical or literal
  - [Perma-frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur) as deathless and fierce evolutions of [frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostifur#Frostifur), and far more powerful than [Alpha-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostifur#Alpha_Frostifur), relating to themes of permafrost -- a classification for a permanently frozen ground in a cold climate
  - Trojans
  - Underworld, as it is the source of the Everfrost Pillar: `You are receiving this mail as a result of an incorrect/cryptic entry in your recent resource allocation request. Please provide a detailed summary of your projected use of the following requested resources:
  ... A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - 'Fiendish Memo'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol)) and is the only known entity to utilize everfrost for its soul-holding power: `The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. ... It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash swarms of angry, frozen souls into the Clockworks.` ([Heart of Ice - Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost_Tower))

- [Lord Vanaduke](#kingdom-of-almire) and his relation to curse

  - [Curse, Darkfire](#nature-of-darkfire) and [unnatural fires](#king-in-the-mountain) as manifestations of influence not from the material realm
  - [Dark embers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember) as the only material related to the nature of the aforementioned fires as not native to material realm
  - Identity of [Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog) as a entity related to concepts of transformation and fire
  - Absent [Vog cubs implied by fiery wolver coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub_Coat) and yet present [ash tail wolvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Ash_Tail)

The idea, which ties those two unique entities, "lords," exists in the surface nature of the influences to which both entities relate, as being located in the Underworld, -- influences such as `dark gods`: `One of many statuettes carried by fiends as a means of gaining favor with their dark gods` ([Wicked idol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol)), -- not restricted to Vog specifically, rather than making it the most present in the current narrative god, but in greater scheme **rendering Underworld as a major and hidden source of unnatural influence onto material realm**, as both Lord Vanaduke's and Maulos's powers have relation to shadow damage.

It is not confirmed weather all encountered on Cradle devilites work for Undercorp, but if Morgral'm's memos are to be considered in relation to Heart of Ice, March of Tortodrones and Grim Gates, it is rather likely that _Undercorp is at the forefront of crossing into material realm_ and is the one to which Crimson Order outsources given tasks:

- `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` ([Work for Idle Hands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands)).
- `Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins` ([Whipping and Mishandling](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling)).

#### Fiendish Cults

Through fiend costume sets it is heavily implied that at least one tangible deity exist in the Underworld:

- `A mask said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will light the path to victory` ([Magmatic Fanatic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask))

    In relation to the motif of masks in Spiral Knights, could _Lord Vanaduke's mask be a visage of a fiery deity_, given overall significance of the mask to the bature of Lord Vanaduke's fires?

- `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail)) - [Fire GOOD!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111013): `burning things while taking on the visage of a fiery deity of martial prowess`

    This is also a peculiar phrasing given context of Lord Vanaduke's trasnformation, as his armor, his nature is tied to fires.

- [Vog Slippers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Slippers#Vog_Slippers) may suggest that Vog is a fiendish entity similar in anatomy to a wolver, as it is grouped with slippers of families of wolvers of [Cozy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box).

    Yet there is evidence of this depiction being a vog cub, rather than deity itself: `The great fire beast Vog. The great fire beast Vog isn't a wolver himself, but a fiery deity of sorts who embraces some creatures and grants them a bit of power. Vog's 'cubs' are more or less acquired and forced to spread his fiery love across the world` ([Forums - Nick Popovich](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776)).

    This framing of Vog's influence allows us to momentary think of Vanaduke's discovery of the [Blackened Shrine](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), _as from this cruel deity's perspective_, __Vanaduke did reclaim his kingdom__. In regards to the connection of Vog to Almire's Fall, we will discuss it in greatest detail in a [separate chapter](#chapter-vii-kingdom-of-almire).

The descriptions of magmatic fanatic armor and helm are very reminiscent of the becoming of Lord Vanaduke, latter explored during the [analysis of Lord Vanaduke](#king-in-the-mountain), and we will propose that it the same powerful entity referred in those cosmetics and analysis of Almire's downfall.

Then, there is a _venom fiend_:

- `A mask said to be crafted in the visage of a venomous fiend. It is infused with a vile essence that is sure to frighten your foes` ([Venom Fiend](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask))
- `A plated mail said to be crafted in the image of a venomous fiend. It comes with a sinister skin suit that pulses with a vile essence` ([Venom Fiend Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Fiend_Mail#Venom_Fiend_Mail))

As the design of the armor is closely similar to the Magmatic set, it is plausible to suggest that a fiend referred here is also a deity -- we will label it as _Vile deity_.

To identify those possible deities, other sources must be looked at. Notably, only magmatic and arctic shackles are present across accessories, other being iron shackles ([Shackles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Shackles#Magmatic_Shackles)), which, through a logical leap, can suggest that some power was responsible for their creation involving frost and magma -- both of those elements being to an extent related to Underworld and powers which bend to Underworld's influence. Arctic shackles in particular are acquired from the [Glacial Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box), which is also related to eldrich identity of Apocrea, explored in the [arctic plot section](#nefarious-imp-arctic-plot).

The role of those cultists will be explored and identified in their [relevant section](#discovery-of-vile-deity).

#### Graveyards

Relevant to the current context in tracking down influences and presence of Underworld are [graveyards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graveyard). Within graveyards there are a few distinct features:

- Some tombstones are cracked and have green essence flowing through their cracks
- Green fires on crypt walls are unique to this location
- Graveyards, as the depths themselves, seem to be located only partially in the material realm. This ethereal motif will be kept track of as we will explore [Kat Tribe and Kataclysm](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe): `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through` ([Information Module: Graveyard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Graveyard)). Our suggestion consists of those locations being in between material realm and Underworld, and are related to the state Cradle is found, connected with the phenomenon of spirits returning to material realm (`Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` - [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness))
- `But stay alert - dark energies resonate from the graveyard, attracted to the countless souls it houses` ([Blades of The Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen)) suggests a certain metaphysical state graveyards exist in which allows for `dark energies` to be identified.

The green color motif may be attributed to several supernatural materials:

- `A bit of ectoplasm meticulously collected from an unwilling undead volunteer. Its an unpleasant shade of green` ([Ecto Drop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ecto_Drop))

    The `unpleasant shade of green` is the descripion of that color, which sems to relate in its color an aspect of death, as it is gathered from the undead.

- `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease` ([Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence))
- The venom fiend:

  - `A mask said to be crafted in the visage of a venomous fiend. It is infused with a vile essence that is sure to frighten your foes` ([Venom Fiend](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask))
  - `A plated mail said to be crafted in the image of a venomous fiend. It comes with a sinister skin suit that pulses with a vile essence` ([Venom Fiend Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Fiend_Mail#Venom_Fiend_Mail))

All of those description relate to an inherent _wrongness of the essence, its color and nature_

As for the plague essence, as its inventory icon being a flame, it can be plausibly tied to the nature of the plague as being not of earthly origin, similar to [Dark Embers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember) despite being embers, distinctly separate themselves from natural existence of material relam, as being potentially the source of unnatural fires of Firestorm Citadel in a similar pattern to everfrost being potential source of unnatural frost.

For now, to avoid too much reference to unexplored topic of Almire, it can be safe to suggest that the essence present within gravestones is related to ectoplasm and, possibly, is the source of [dust zombies'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Dust_Zombie) green eyes, -- with all of those elements eventually finding their explanation in nature of Underworld.

### _Chapter `III` &#160;<br>_ Tortomega

As dragons, both european and eastern vision, had existed across many cultures, so were their localized subspecies, such as drakes, wyrms, wyverns and so on.

We propose, this relationship is also found in present cosmology, but not in the _symbolic and cultural form of evolution, but rather a biological one_, as if dragons, as they are establsihed to be [essential to the creation myth and cosmology](#creation-myth-dragons-as-cosmic-progenitors), so are wyvern and drakes are tangible species and distant descendants of dragons.

From [dragons](#dragons), referred to as `creatures of legend` (`A mythical shield crafted from the scales of a creature of legend` - [Dragon Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield)), their descendants were born: drakes and potentially wyverns ([Wyvern Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield)), explored later in their correponding items' alchemy paths:

- `A helmet crafted from the scales of beasts thought to be the descendants of dragons` ([Drake Scale Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Helm))
- `Armor forged from the scales of beasts thought to be descendants of dragons` ([Drake Scale Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Mail))

This positions drakes as descendants of dragons. Here, an important distinction must be made of dragons as they are described in different cultures. Specifically, it is the differences of a _continental european dragon_ and a _celtic dragon_. It will be important in relation to a further discussed [valkyries of heavenly kingdom](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom), but before that -- for understanding of wyverns and drakes as separate species.

Germanic and then northern depictions of dragons are _wingless and limbless serpents_. European dragons are depicted as _winged creatures with 4 legs and a pair of wings_, consider Welsh Dragon.

Here, a comparison with drakon battle sprites must be made: they possess front limbs and occasionally wings or large paws, depending on their evolution, while the consistent element among their evolutions is the jagged jaw and a pair of horns on the back of the head.

It can be argued that dragons' canon form had wings based on [dragon wings accessory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Wings), although wings of explicitly storm, rage, and frenzy [do differ](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings_of_Rage#Wings_of_Rage), resembling the prismatic _artificial_ counterpart, whose place of all seem to belong to [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) due to their thematic parity and slimmer build. Presence of wings as well as overall look of drakon battle sprites could suggest that the dragons were of a european design.

Wyverns, as a name suggests, are similar to wyrns or Lindworms -- another name for _germanic dragons_, -- they have _2 limbs and wings_.

In western folklore, drakes were considered same as dragons, but over time the term had changed to characterize _drakes as wingless 4-legged smaller creatures_ related to dragons. It is important to reintroduce presence of dragons in alchemy -- notably within a concept of union of opposites, -- represented as a caduceus and deep relation to god Mercurius.

#### Tortoise Ancestry

Previously discussed in [introduction of dragons](#dragons), [Dragon Scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale) are used in transmutation of [Dragon Scale set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Mail) (`Mythical armor crafted from the scales of a creature of legend`), and [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) (`A shield created from the armor of a Tortomega. The sheer weight of this powerful shield makes it only an option for the strongest of warriors`).

The [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) introduces Tortomega: `shield created from the armor of a Tortomega`, which is also found in [Gorgomega](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgomega): `A terrifying shield that combines the dual-crushing power of a gorgo and the mythical tortomega. Crushing enemies has never been more fiendishly fun`. The precursor of Omega Shell, the [Stone Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise) (`A large, powerful shield made to resemble a creature's shell. Its formidable weight can make attacking more difficult`) shield does not use dragon scales in its alchemy, but [Drake Scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale), implying a relation between drakes and tortoises. Drakes are known to be descendants of dragons through [Drake Scale Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Mail) -- `Armor forged from the scales of beasts thought to be descendants of dragons.`

Those descriptions, alchemy path and prevalence of a naming convention and motif of tortoises, we propose, imply a __lineage__ --  tortoises were related, as reptiles, to drakes who are the descendants of dragons.

As drakes are not considered flying species, they fit to be the ancestors of tortoises by being a __terrestrial__ _reptilian descendants of dragons_. If this logic is to be applied to the rest of alchem path, then _tortomega would be of a similar ancestry_. There is also [Wyvern Scale Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Mail), which introduces species of wyverns: `It requires extreme temperatures to forge this fine armor made from the scales of rare Clockworks beasts.`

This motif of tortoises anounces a relation between tortomega and tortodrones -- wherein tortodrones' anatomy attains reason to be designed so. Tortodrones are _constructs_ designed as __athropomorphic bipedal tortoises__.

We will offer 2 hypothesis on this design choice:
- Either tortodrones are _designed and built in an image of its creator specie_, or;
- Tortodrones were designed by it creators specifically _to invoke an image of a tortoise both as a dangerous and powerful creature_, given destructive potential, not directly firepower, of an enraged, albeit corrupted tortodrone.

This symbolism of a tortoise had to be acknowledged, as we attempt to identify the creators of tortodrones. So far we will assume that __tortoises are terrestrial descendats of drakes__

#### Omega Shell and Tortomega: Motif of Resiliency

As we develop the proposal of tortoises being descendants of dragons, we may may approach th identitis of those species from items, transmuted from [ancient shells](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell) (`A fragment of resilient Tortodrone shell. It is rumored that by sleeping on a Tortodrone shell, one can feel the subtle vibrations that call these mighty beings towards the Long Migration's mysterious final destination`), recovered from tortodrones as those are reminiscent of tortoises.

Among those items, [Primal Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Shell) describes resistance to fire and frost: `A shield alchemized from the shell of a tortodrone. The plates used in its construction provide some protection against the elements of fire and freeze`. The environmental aspect may imply that this equipment builds upon properties of the ancient shells, the description of [Barrier Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barrier_Shell) suggests that the resistances are inherent to tortodrones: `A shield alchemized from the shell of a tortodrone. The elemental resiliency of a tortodrone on the Long Migration should aid you on your own journeys through harsh environments.` Attunement with elements is also seen in [Barrier Cannon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barrier_Cannon): `A handgun alchemized from the shell of a tortodrone. The elemental offense of a tortodrone on the Long Migration should aid you on your own expeditions.`

Frost is reminiscent of Blinding Abyss and Underworld, but also given tortoise motif coupled with mystery of the Long Migration makes us think of the __Giant Tortoises' migration patterns__. It is also here we point out ability of tortoise to hibernate in winters, similar to a tortodrone migration: `Now, the tortodrones are being called on the Long Migration. Even the Strangers do not know the reasons for this mysterious event but these giant, robotic tortoises can be glimpsed traveling through the clockworks` ([March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones)). While those similarities does not answer the reason for the migration, a natural or elemental theme of _resiliency_ is prevalent even if theme of tortodrone's rage is one more distinct and present.

As tortoises are positioned through alchemy path as different from tortomega that distinction had to reflect the reality. In this context creators of tortodrones had to possess excessive knowledge of tortoises in order to create machines in their image, which implies __the significance of tortoises to tortodrones' creators culture__.

We propose that tortomega are those conscious species comprising the civilization responsible for creation of tortodrones, descendants of tortoises.

#### Symbolism of Power in Tortomega

The name of tortomega, found in the [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell): `A shield created from the armor of a Tortomega. The sheer weight of this powerful shield makes it only an option for the strongest of warriors` hints at the significane of power for the supposed species through utilization of differrnt renditions of a term "mega": Omega Shell, [Omegaward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward).

Based on [Merriam-Webster definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mega), "mega" refers to metaphorical or literal scale, power, greatness, which, when observed within the context of tortomega specie, aligns with the description of multiple items:

- `The sheer weight of this powerful shield makes it only an option for the strongest of warriors` ([Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell)).
- `The pulsing elemental plates of this shield instantaneously react to adverse climates protecting you from even the most extreme cold or heat` ([Omegaward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward)).
- `A handgun alchemized from a hardened tortodrone shell. While wielding it you can feel the primal energy of a rampaging wolver pack within waiting to be unleashed` ([Savage Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortofist)).
- `A handgun empowered by the limitless fury of a tortodrone. While wielding it you are capable of unleashing the energy of a legion of tortodrones upon your foes` ([Omega Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Tortofist)).
- `A shield empowered by the limitless fury of a tortodrone. The very plates of this colossal carapace shake as the unstable energy within waits to be unleashed` ([Grand Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortoise)).

Exploration of tortodrones currently goes beyond current discussion, and will be explored in the [tortodrones section](#anatomy-of-tortodrone-and-crimsonite), but an essential conclusion can now be made through the semantics of the alchemy paths -- of _resilience and power of tortodrone as, seemingly, a conscious design choice_.

#### Wyverns and Chromalisks

Here a closer look at the alchemy tree must be made: while drakes are descendants of dragons, [Dragon Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield) is a 5-star upgrade - by this logic [Wyvern Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield) could be a species being at transition of dragons to drakes, but this logic fails if mythological interpretations of those species are to be considered, as drakes and wyverns do not belong to a single habitat, one being terrestrial and other aerial.

<!--Another perspective is found in the alchemy path and continuous disclosure of ancestry and relations though gear star upgrades. Considering again real world definition of drakes, with addition of tortoises, the latter could be further evolution of drakes. Taking this in account, as well as dragon set alchemy path, [Omega shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) could mean that tortomega are a different specie, related to both dragons and tortoise, based on its naming scheme.-->

At that same time [chromalisks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chromalisk) exist as ones to be close to drakes and to even drop both [drake scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale) and dragon scales. As _chromalisks lack wings_, they also may be descendants of drakes, with wyverns during that time remaining in the sky.

The [Wyvern Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield) being an upgrade of [Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield) but required for [Dragon Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield), having [Chroma Tear](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chroma_Tear) as the rest of dragon-themed items, may connect them all under a single ancestry as well as place wyverns as a potential species that either were at a transition to drakes, or older than drakes yet of same draconic ancestry.

#### Exclusion of Tortodrones' Creators

Considering the similarity in naming of tortoises and tortomega and lack of any non-mechanical tortoise creatures, apart from a single stone shell of a tortoise, presence of a tortoises is the main hint, through which tortodrone creators' species may be uncovered.

Here we will advocate for tortodrones being built in image of a bipedal tortomega, as tortodrones themselves -- _as bipedalism, anthromorphism of tortoises may originate from a bipedal specie_, so that tortodrone creators are tortoise-like specie, advanced and skilled enough to engineer and mass-produce those constructs, while discussing other possibilities based on presented in-game content.

##### Gremlin Scenario

The one and only candidate for such species with engineering skills are gremlins, which would mean that they are far more ancient than Clockworks makes them seem. And yet, tortodrones don't fit thematically and design-wise to be gremlin creation, as it will be later explored, the themes surrounding tortodrones, apart from their character, are of an _environment identified by nature, stone megaliths and forests_, -- Gloaming Wildwoods specifically, -- and an established presence of distinct architecture.

Gremlins in that regard may be linked to grim gates in the Ancient Grove, as those have several mounted monitors of similar gremlin design. On the other hand, this can be further proof of gremlins working with Undercorp in recent times, on both instances, it gremlins do not possess stonework designs.

Tortodrones have a relation to devilites, same as gremlins. Gremlins share a connection with devilites, whom they outsource their work: `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` ([Work for Idle Hands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands)).

Gun puppies are present within the ruins of wildwoods, sky islands, and Scarlet Fortress -- all of these factors, while seem as compelling evidence for gremlins being said specie, again, does not fit thematically, -- that of a relation with shadow and elemental technology and their placement in relation to different locations within Clockworks. The point regarding gun puppies will be discussed in the [stone constructs section](#stone-constructs).

Then there is [evil eye symbolism on gremlin machinery](#the-collector), such as the [Collector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale), for whom will will later analyze significate of an eye -- a symbol comming from Underworld, -- for gremlin civilization. Tortodrone do possess this symbolism -- as is engraved on their shells both on the enraged uncorrupted tortodrone of [mission's title card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)), and on weapons [transmuted from the ancient shells](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell#Usage), specifically their outline on 4-star items and a complete glowing variant on 5-star items.

The rest of connections will will be explored in the analysis of [Undercorp](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), of which we will evaluate weather graviton technology had allowed linking of material realm with the Underworld, manipulation of gravity and capacity to inflict shadow damage, which had to be in greater development and application, if gremlins adopted it earlier in the timeline.

The observed focus of gremlin technology is mainly elemental damage and shock. Crimson Order is an exception here, as its' members -- Warmaster Seerus specifically (`It is thought to have been reserved for use against other members of the Crimson Order` - [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution)), -- utilize shadow bombs as well as several [other weapons](#cradle-defenses), making shadow damage seem as of greater danger and higher secrecy. In case of tortodrones, presence of shadow is characteristic only of corrupted tortodrone, not their natural variants seen at the end of the [Call of the Colossi depth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Call_of_the_Colossi).

<!--If gremlins did engineer tortodrones present on Cradle that would mean Clockworks were built either during that time or after but remained within realm of gremlin influence, which would not explain presence of the _Great Colony as a term denoting colony -- not a homeworld, but a dependent region controlled externally and established by a greater empire of that specie, with an assigned emperor or a king_. One entity close to this concept is implied to exist king Tinkinzar. The truthfulness of Tinkinzar's existence will be explored later in [chapter on gremlins](#gremlin-empire). In the context of tortodrones, this would mean, that gremlins salvaged this regions for Cradle while being present there.-->

Those factors make gremlins seem as less plausible candidate for tortodrones' creators compared to mythological tortomega.

##### Devilite Scenario

White sigils at [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi) and their combinations resebling ritual circles have same symbols that are used by devilites, but, in case of tortodrones, their components have a different design compared to devilites'. Their composition as of _pale white mineral_ is also not particularly common, the closest instance being _cold-white mineral_ found surrounding [Everfrost Pillar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice).

Considering overall design of those circles, even outside of the meaning of devilite ritual circles, yet considering presence of corrupted tortodrones, this seems more of a _protective measure of deactivated tortodrones_, possibly from tampering and utilizing same magic as devilites themselves use, and, as later will be seen, [undead Kat Tribe](#kat-tribe) at Moorcroft Manor.

Only a civilization with similar knowledge of minerals could them be capable of applying those circles with consideration of tortodrones' construction, which would be their creators. This may suggest that the technology powering tortodrones is similar to one of devilites a 2 scenarios:

- Devilites would adapt tortodrones to utilize not dark matter, but as later seen, crimsonite;
- A different civilization has a potential to work with devilites, as gremlins did, to create tortodrones, while utilizing prior's knowledge of _minerals as a power source_.

##### Spiral Order Scenario

Civilization of Spiral Order also should be noted as a potential lead, as suggested by shape of [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor) as well as `items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrones` ([Ancient Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box)), which do fit their anatomy, but explicitly stated to be `fashioned in` those designs.

If we to consider civilization behind Spiral Order as creators of tortodrones and were inhabitants of this remote land, referred as the `veiled homeland`, we would not have any further lead to affirm this proposal.

#### Unreconciled Duality of Fury and Serenity

Given above covereage of potential species to be identifiable as tortodrones' creators, we will follow the proposition of them being tortomega. While tortomega, if assumed so, remain unknown, we can gather information on the context of that civilization from the perspective of tortodrones. Specifically, there is a distinct duality of `limitless fury` (`A shield empowered by the limitless fury of a tortodrone` - [Grand Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortoise)) of a tortodrone and a serenity of a `veiled homeland` (`Contains various unique items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrones` - [Ancient Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box)).

While we have covered the fury property as we have discussed motif of power, the serenity of the homeland was not:

- `Contains various unique items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrones` ([Ancient Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box)).
- `An ancient, resilient helmet covered in a soft layer of moss. Within the cool, stony interior of this helmet you can hear a faint and soothing song formed by the rustle of winds traveling from distant lands` ([Serene Pith Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Serene_Pith_Helm)).

This duality, we propose, hints at a certain conflict, a _motif of unrealized vengeance of a fallen civilization_ found in a few future instances. While it requires elaboration, the contrast itself hints at an _unreconciled state of tortodrones and their creators_, a __lack of resolution__.

#### Motif of Stone and Serenity, Titans

There are several both metaphorical and literal instances of a term _titans_:

- `A suit of artifact armor that is said to have been worn by titans` ([Ancient Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor)).

  An initial connection is established between so far metaphorical titan and a quality of being ancient, distant in time.

- `A vestigial helm whose weight makes it unwieldy to all but those with titanic strength` ([Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm)).

  The term `vestigial` characterises it as essential in the past, poentially ancient past, but in modern times it is considered rudimentary, not required. The bearer -- a titan, -- is further characterized as possessor of titanic strength, which, as a term itself suggests, can be interpreted metaphorically or literally.

- Mossy design of [Troika](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika), `A low-tech sword that makes up for its lack of high internal power with sheer weight and size. It is capable of delivering crushing blows for those that can handle it`, similar to other ancient-themed items has a significant importance of weight and power, manifested in its 5-star designs.

  Despite Troika having Spiral Order variant, as well as wielded by Spiral Order -- primarily by [Izola in the Hall of Heroes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Izola), -- it seems the design was acquired rather recently, after Skylark crash landed on Cradle, as the weapon is upgraded as the knight progresses the campaign, compared to both different themes of items in the alchemy path of [Cobalt armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor), and a nature of modernised designs emerging from Troika as a mossy relic from a past.

  The 5-star variants, specifically [Triglav](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav) hint at a mythical importance of the weapon, despite the subversion of the narrative of a mythical weapon: `No stories have been told about this almighty blade, but that's only because people are rarely in the mood to talk after having been crushed by a mountain.`

  Yet, the design of Torika alchemy tree retain an _incorporated symbol of energy_, which itself suggest that weapon might have been of Spirtal Order design from a distant past. This property introduces a possibility of titans being Spiral Order ancestors, which would require a resolution of those locations being visited by SPiral Order ancestors in the past.

- `A large, powerful shield made to resemble a creature's shell` ([Stone Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise)). The creature in question is a tortoise.

  Design of [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) points at Tortomega: `A shield created from the armor of a Tortomega. The sheer weight of this powerful shield makes it only an option for the strongest of warriors` and has same design as [Stone Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise), albeit darker, which was the argument in favour of identification of tortomega as tortoises-like species.

- `A legendary suit of armor said to imbue the wearer with the rage of the titans` ([Rageous Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rageous_Plate_Mail#Rageous_Plate_Mail)) describes a link between rage and titans within a framing of the titans as a distinct species with a connection to older interpretations of elements.

  As this equipment comes from the same prize box as dragon helms, where the [creation myth was established](#creation-myth-dragons-as-cosmic-progenitors), these items may also be, given their elemental naming convention, of that most ancient period of time.

  Notably, compared to previously discussed items of those prize boxes, there are different entities attributed to those elemental qualities:

  - `A legendary suit of armor said to imbue the wearer with the frenzy of a thousand demigods` ([Frenzy Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Plate_Mail#Frenzy_Plate_Mail)).
  - `A legendary suit of armor said to imbue the wearer with the rage of the titans` ([Rageous Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rageous_Plate_Mail#Rageous_Plate_Mail)).
  - `A legendary suit of armor said to imbue the wearer with the might of heavenly thunder` ([Thunderous Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderous_Plate_Mail#Thunderous_Plate_Mail)).

  This separation implicitly ties rage to titans.

- `items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrones` ([Ancient Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box)) such as [Serene Tailed Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Serene_Tailed_Helm) directly link application of stone with tortodrones' history:

  - `An ancient, resilient helmet covered in a soft layer of moss. Within the cool, stony interior of this helmet you can hear a faint and soothing song formed by the rustle of winds traveling from distant lands` ([Serene Tailed Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Serene_Tailed_Helm)).
  - `An ancient suit of armor weathered by the elements. While standing in this armor you can sense the far-off tremors caused by the migration of countless tortodrones journeying to lands unknown` ([Serene Culet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Serene_Culet#Serene_Culet)).

  Items of this prize box have a resemblience of the ancient plate armor only to a degree, as the latter does not follow [`ancient` color scheme](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient), yet their naming convention involves a quality of being `serene` and ancient. The [Ancient Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Shield) also is being set apart due to presence of metal.

  Serene items introduce a theme revolving around serenity and stone, as an extension of themes tortodrones encapsulate: `Listen to the faint and soothing song formed by wind traveling from a distant land, or feel the tremors caused by the march of the Long Migration. Equip your knight with serene costumes and ancient accessories.` ([March of the Tortodrones!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/97506)).

Based on those references to stone and titans, a network of connections may be established between _motif of stone as symbolic for ancient time and strength_, linked to tortodrones, who are chacterized by strength and ancient time.

On the contrary, there are a few issues with this attempt to group the titans as a single civilization referenced in above instances:

- The [Ancient Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Shield) does not fit into an establish design pattern by presence of spirals and distinct energy symbol, as they are associated with Spiral Order's alchemy and technology of their shields. We will return to this symbol in relation to its placement on armors during our later analysis of Spiral Order technology.
- The very fact of, as we will see further, Ancient Plate eqipment is attained through [Almirian Seals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Token#Almirian_Seal) should connect it with Almire. We should consider multiple potential identities of the titans as we cover each of the known factions.
- There are titants of the creation myth involving dragons with corresponding armor designs of storms, rage and frenzy, which surpass stone equipment in their craftsmanship.
- The quality of equipment being made of stone may serve the reason for identification of the wearer as a metaphorical titan due to their strength. Here, the term "titan" would be resolved by being a metaphor. While the quality of being made of stone is shared between Ancient Plate eqipment and Serene gear, the Rageous Plate Mail exists separately due to its design. This distinction is a valid hint at those titans being unrelated entities. And as there are diffent entities noted in corresponding plate armors, _rageous titans may be the only literal species of titans_.

While the identity of titants yet remains ambigious, a working assumption may be presented.

Based on previous counterarguments presented in favour of gremlins, Isorans or devilites being tortodrones' creators, we suggest, due to common theme of stone and rage, tortomega possess most of the potential to be the titans relying on application of stone for:

- Tortodrones as constructs with stone exterior, as built in image of a supposed species;
- Stone architecture of [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove);
- The roster of serene equipment, as evidence of that civilization possessing a distinct culture and recognizable stonework designs;
- Quality of rage so far had not found an embodiment as deeply tied to rage as torodrones, which ties back to the ancestry of tortomega. Of course, this would have a cascading effect onto the structure of the timeline, which we will explore and attempt to resolve.

Yet, this _does not explain_ the naming convention of titans and the distinct design of [Rageous Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rageous_Plate_Mail#Rageous_Plate_Mail). As far as present descriptions allow, the titans might be ancestors of Spiral Order or a different, no less ancient species associated with stone, even a third civilization existing near the time of a creation myth.

More so, the term titans creates cultural associations with mythology, such as _jotun, giants of norse mythology_, _titans of greek mythology_, _fomorians of irish mythology_, where each of those species may fit into corresponding time periods described by the above eqipment.

Both across the myths -- as titans and giants, -- and as dragons of this cosmogony, they embody an entity or entities, who would become a __literal, physical foundation of the world__, being essential to the creation myth. While in Spiral Knights' cosmology this role of world progenitors is delegated to dragons, its universe's titans might have to be placed if not alongside them, then in their temporal proximity, similar to riders given their initial identification as gods.

This, as stated earlier, requires us to look for other potential candidates at a role of titans across the timeline to fulfill similar role.

We will make our _current working assumtion_, based on the above motif of stone, serenity, and in less explored manner rage that __titans are a colloqual term for tortomega civilization__ identified by rage.

#### Veiled Tortodrone Homeland

Tortomega, as creators of tortodrones, would establish a `distant homeland`, a region which had their chacateristic architecture found only in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove) -- `Contains various unique items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrone` ([Ancient Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box), -- where their ruins are, reminiscent of the style of carvings on tortodrones and [related gear, transmuted from the ancient shells](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell#Usage).

We propose that Ancient Grove is part of the Gloaming Wildwoods and all of the woods were inhabited by tortomega, as terrestial reptilian species.

The connection between Wildwoods and Ancient Grove is found in the similarity of the ruins, _same strata of architecture_, evident by stone gun puppy statues, and _a unique glowing mushrooms present across the biomes_. The same statues and mushrooms are present in the [Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle). Then, only statues remain in the [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles) and [Wolver Dens](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver_Den), suggesting that prior to those locations being divided and placed into skydomes, _those regions were in close proximity to each other within a territory inhabited by tortomega_, close enough for the biosphere to spread and allow buildings of the same architectural style to be constructed.

It must be also noted thet Starlight Cradle, Gloaming Wildwoods and Aurora Isles all have large rectangular indestructable blocks made of dark stone with the __glowing valestone-like spiral carved in its' sides__, _glowing only at night time_ of encompassing the areas skydomes. Cultural and spiritual meaning of this symbol will be explored further as we find it in different contexts, this depiction being no less important.

It is unknown weather those regions could be considered the `veiled homeland`, given the view of tortodrones still at their migration at the end of Call of The Colossi. So, there are a few interpretation we can suggest, given current conclusions:

- The distant location of the veiled homeland is temporal -- it foes not exist as a unified landmass, but rather its is split into smaller regions and only identified by a common archeological strata.
- Veiled homeland is a region left unseen or undiscvered due to greater scope of Cradle in the same manner as gremlins' Great Colony was not yet explored in-game and a suggestion of a biotech in the Haven Lab regarding Almire -- `there were massive citadels housing Almire's armed forces and great estates for its noble houses ... We assume the kingdom is still a smoldering ruin somewhere`, -- as so far only single Citadel was explored properly during The King of Ashes.

The latter option, given context of megastructure's scale, seems more plausible, while the prior would grant this narrative greater depth without a distinct conflict of interpretations. As the setting of Cradle so far was the only one to be explored, apart from exceptions such as [Apocrean Realm](#apocrean-realm), we propose veiled homeland to exist within the volume of Clockworks and Cradle.

#### Extinction of Dragons

At some point in time, dragons had perished, anouncing the [creation myth](#creation-myth). Their powers reshaped the planet (`created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` - [Storm Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm)) changing terrain (`its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` [Raging Dragon Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm)) and creating storms.

The [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Rider_Mantle#Frenzy_Rider_Mantle) refer to 3 gods using their respective elements to `carve worlds from stone` -- the meaning of carving worlds from stone may refer to a metaphysical act of creation, or a literal carving of land.

Given those currently separated narratives, we had drawn parallels with similar entities of greek and norse emythology, of norse giants, titans and Olympian gods.

This had allows us to propose a scenario rooted in mythologocal parallels assumed to be a [war between dragons and riders](#lesser-creaton-myth). This idea would serve us as a scaffolding for further exploration of the story, as such logic would allow us to create suitable premise for further developments in attempt to build a cohesive narrative.

With the mythology as a guide, to achieve further progress in identification of tortodrones, tortomega, titans and riders, we should approach from a diffent perspective, from the analysis of a different civilization -- Valkyries.

### _Chapter `IV` &#160;<br>_ Heavenly Kingdom

  <div class="decorate-contents">
    <img class="decorate-contents-img" src={imgHeavenlyKingdom} />
  </div>
</div>

It is most evident that equipment found in [Rage Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Prize_Box), [Stormy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stormy_Prize_Box), and [Frenzy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Prize_Box) implies existence of at least one civilization, responsible for creation of that gear.

As we have established initial relation [between stone, tortoises and tortomega](#omega-shell-and-tortomega), we found an image of a civilization of sentient giant tortoises, tortomega -- descendants of drakes, and far descendants of dragons of rage through [consistent motif of rage](#unreconciled-duality-of-fury-and-serenity) within tortodrones and their equipment, as pointers to an inherently rageous nature of those specie.

While we were searching for the identity of titans, we have proposed their nature to be tortomega through [motifs and applications surrounding the material of stone](#motif-of-stone-and-serenity-titans). We had pointed out a notion of [draconic creation myth](#creation-myth-dragons-as-cosmic-progenitors) to resemble other real-world creation myths, which had allowed us to suggest a reason for dragons to perish in the first place -- a conflict would take place between dragon deities and other faction of formidable power, which would come on top and dragons being considered extinct.

This confict of deity-like factions was proposed in the [lesser creation myth](#lesser-creaton-myth), where we have linked _Rider gods_ to _Olympian pantheon_, immitating a paradigm shift found through Olympian gods' establishment of supreme power after their rebellion against greek Titans.

This faction's lightning-based designs are particularly similar to Valkyrian and Spiral Order gear in their respective design elements and mythological contexts, which we will now elaborate upon. In order to establish those similarities, we will elaborate on the Valkyrian gear, as we reference equipment associated with frenzy, rage and storms:

- `A priceless helmet whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` ([Valkyrie Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm)).

  The connection within the description and the name allows to identify those __heavenly guardians as Valkyries__, as well as their relation to the Underworld, implying a conflict between Valkyries and fiends of Underworld.

  More so, this category of helmets _possesses imagery of a spiral_, which we also take note of, as plausibly significant symbol among Valkyrian culture, similar to application of _glowing spirals in tortomega strata_.

- `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a snow-covered/magma-covered/wind-swept mountain` ([Avenger Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm)).

  This equipment has distinct [round helm design](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spiral_Round_Helm) and back wings identical to [Angelic Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm): `A beautiful helm made to resemble a heavenly guardian`.

  As heavenly guardians are mentioned in both instances, it is most plausible that this civilization had existed for a long enough period of time for those designs to be incorporated into their culture, mostplausibly referring the same civilization at different points in time.

- `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed/razed the gates of a heavenly kingdom` ([Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Champion_Helm)), suggests an existence of a faction possessing same power of elements as the `heavenly guardians` ([Angelic Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm)), but being at conflict with them in order to _storm and then raze_ `the gates of a heavenly kingdom`:

  - `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed the gates of a heavenly kingdom. Some say the thunderclaps are the eternal echoes of her siege` ([Storm Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Champion_Helm#Storm_Champion_Helm)).
  - `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed the gates of a heavenly kingdom. Some say that whistling wings are the eternal warcries of her siege` ([Frenzy Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Champion_Helm#Frenzy_Champion_Helm)).

  This association of forces of nature with a distinct human event frames it in a tone of a myth, elevating it above its instances due to seemingly deific nature its parties.

  As the helm belongs to `one who defied the gods`, and [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) define at least one god to carve ambigious worlds with depiction an armor of complex design, we would suggest that _the term of a heavenly kingdom_ in this context __implies a literal kingdom__, _with divinity attributed to it in the same capacity as its heaven-based location_.

  Those details are not characteristic of dragons, if we woild propose them to be that opposing force, as dargons are depicted as more _animalistic yet powerful beings or even forces of nature_.

  The Champion Helm is similar to [Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm) whose belonging was rather ambiguous due to unknown origin and themes, yet plated helms, including [Volcanic Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Helm) possess a unique for them face plate of 2 vertical colums of 2 occulariums. We wkeep this design in mind as we get to the analysis of [volcanic gear](#volcanic-elements).

  The theme and naming convention of heavenly kingdom and valkyries seem to suggest that the kingdom in question and _valkyries being its guardians are this Universe's stand-in for_ __Valhalla__.

- [Rider Mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) have prismatic elements incorporated in their designs, specifically, [wings of fury, storms and frenzy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings_of_Fury#Wings_of_Fury) or [regular prismatic wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings).

  The [Eye of fury](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_fury) exists separately, but allows for a motif of rage to be extended onto those species, rather than delegated to tortomega exclusively. It may be the case of _rage element being present or manifested in modern day Cradle only through tortodrones_, which would seem to be a more plausible explanation without breaking an established system.

  This notion of rage or fury coupled with the lightning motif of riders may provide further character to the potentially avian nature of this civilization, given context of heavenly kingdom and application of an image of a mythological Valkyrie.

  This symbolic relation gains more depth in the context of those symbols -- of Valkyris, thunder and rage, -- in the assumption of this civilization being related to rider gods through common application of those elements, as the postion of riders is framed in the narrative of a defic war with dragons, paralleling Olympian gods.

- Sigils on [rider mantles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle) do not resemble anything else seen on Cradle, fiendish sigils, [Owlite enchantments](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Enchanter_Aura-Equipped.png), or [Sorcerer Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sorcerer_Aura#Sorcerer_Aura).
- `A brilliant, white helm belonging to a heavenly warrior` ([Heavenly Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Helm)).

  This helm has Spiral Order energy symbol and design similar to [Azure Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm) or [mighty cobalt helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Helm).

  This similarity to Spiral Order designs is also present in Valkyrian armors, such as [Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) and its 5-star alternatives in the alchemy tree of [Angelic Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm), having same energy symbol and overall shape suggesting anatomical or cultural similarities of Spiral Order and Valkyries, although the species are distinguished from each other: `It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire` ([Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm)) through a naming convention and physical traits.

  Could it be that past existence of Spiral Order was of those exact heavenly warriors, identified as or related to Valkyries as the celestial beings? The appearance of the species which is Spiral Order may plausibly fit into such description from the initial sight. While we do not have enough evidence to suggest so, those similarities remain a topic of discussion.

- `Brilliant, white armor worn by those who defended the heavenly realms` ([Heavenly Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor)).

  As an armor paired with the aforementioned helmet, it has a design feature of pale yellow light trains on its handguards. Those trails are similar to the aura of [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger). This may imply a possibility of this sword being attributed to that ancient period of time, but the presence of curse symbolism contradicts it, as no curse was yet introduced into the narrative, remaining adjacent to classical western mythology.

  It is important to note here that Spiral Order does not have mastery of elemental damage, as evident by [Archilus' dialogue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Archilus): `Elemental resistant armor and shields are adapted from Owlite technology. Though the Owlites themselves no longer exist, their amazing elemental mastery lives on in this gear`, but their technology allows for curse and other status effects to be nullified through application of [remedy capsule](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pickups#Capsules).

If Spiral Order was at some point related to heavenly kingdom, it must have happened far into the past, which would require then an in-depth explanation and solid reason for the design similarities.

This scenario is possible if the equipment is _anatomically and thematically adapted to fit species of Spiral Order_, with the original designs being relatively similar. We suggest such explanation due to explicit case of [gremlin suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Suit): `A special suit tailored by a gremlin's touch to fit the frame of a knight`, and [Owlite robes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Robe): `A costume recreation of the fine robes worn by Owlites, based on the most recent archaeological findings`. Such cases anounce a theme of _Spiral Order incorporating other civilizations' designs into their equipment_.

Within the existing roster of transmutable armors [cobalt armors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor) and [padded armors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor) are the most distinct Spiral Order designs, which are thematically different from mythological themes of heavenly warriors. We will keep this potential notion in mind, until we will cover both parties.

In terms of naming conventions it is also here we are implicitly given a few terms for _heavenly guardians_ as _avengers, Valkyries, and celestial beings_.

Furthermore, the avian designs are found in handguns. They imply a cultural significance of those traits to culture which had those guns manufactured, similar to the appearance of tortodrones as an image radiating power and rage.

Based on a design of [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) and its description: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`, -- there must have been an Underworld present and some civilizations would have been aware of its existence.

The handgun's name -- griffin, -- has depiction of anatomy similar to a dragon, especially with its recognizable muzzle, now having 4 legs and wings, and back horns reminiscent of the Drakon battle sprite, despite in being named after a differnt specie, while there are other handgun decorated with less draconic features.

Those handguns possess multiple damage types, while modern Spiral Order is mostly unaware of shadow damage, and barely of elemental damage, fully relying on normal and piercing damage types.

With those disperse elements we can construct an image of an ancient civilization of Valkyries, reminiscent of Olympian pantheon, possessing same as deific dragons elements of storms, rage and frenzy, and residing within and guarding the fortress of the heavenly kingdom.

With the descriptions of both creation myths, we derive a narrative where dragons were hunted as divine species, with the hunters being the other civilization of gods which had "carved worlds from stone."

With this, there is a subtle link between Owlites as a single avian civilization and Valkyries.

#### Depictions of an Owlite Dragon

As far as we are aware, there is only one _firmly_ established avian civilization -- Owlites. There are 2 imporant chacteristics of this civilization:

- They are aware of Almire, but exist 1000 years after the kingdom had fallen: `The remaining pages are too deteriorated to decipher anything further save for a date of the events described which suggest that the Kingdom of Almire was destroyed over a thousand years ago` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep - The Forgotten Library - Owlite tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_tome_text_Dialogue/The_Forgotten_Library)).
- They are affiliated with the Owlite Academy of Magics, now known as the Candlestick Keep.

The prior point position Valkyries as on the other end of the timeline, at its beginning. The latter point allows for further analysis if the castle-like architecture of the Academy. And, it is there we find particular depictions of _Drakon-like heads across the halls and their arched walls_. The same design pattern is unmistakably observed at the Scarlet Fortress and other location, including the Gauntlet.

Similar designs are found across the scattered floating landmasses of sky islands, Starlight Cradle and other regions, including Wildwoods, wherein large amounts of the same strata of architecture is present. There, we are interested in the very specific presence of _statues, near-identical to gun puppies in their appearance_ of __a rectangular snout and horns__.

As in case of darkon battle sprites, this apperance is most likely is the appearance of a dragon, suggesting both tortomega civilization and now Owlites are aware of them to an extent deep enough to depict, incorporate into architecture and so forth immortalize their image.

To paraphrase, given nature of dragons, _tortomega and owlites share a cultural notion of depicting ancient and powerful creatures within their architecture_.

We suspect, while Owlites reside in their own narrative mostly unrelated to the rest of Clockwork, their ancestry might be of very Valkyries, _connected by avian nature and theming_ and, notably, a lack of other species of similar habitation, unless Spiral Order may be identified as the celestial beings.

With this, our current assumption will be of __identification of Valkyries as ancestors of Owlites__.

#### Castles of Cradle

Castles located across Cradle and Clockworks possess a few common architectural elements, which allow us to group and attribute them to distinct factions.

As in the case of floating islands of [veiled tortodrone homeland proposal](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland), most of castle-like structures within Clockworks are observed to be floating across megastructure's internal volume suspended in the air. As we analyze the castles, we whould take in consideration their distinct dislocation outside of skydomes. This property of Cradle to seemingly create artificial gravity further elaborates on metaphysical nature of energy and the details of the [motif of excess of energy](#energy) within Clockworks:

- `A latent strand of energy that floats throughout the Clockworks ... its too large to properly distill into Energy` ([Static Clinger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Clinger)).
- `massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core ... mass of negative energy` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora)).

##### Owlite Architecture

- [Scarlet Fortress](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress) is stated to be `drifting endlessly in the void of the clockworks`. It is one of the largest castle-like structures, as it takes up entire field of view, going beyond it, with occasional cogs of Clockworks being faintly observed below.

  This castle structure coming from a distinctly different period of time further establishes for us a notion of artifacts of an unconnected but distinctly anceint past existing within Clockworks as representation of a yet to be defined narrative.

  This would fit with the idea of a kingdom in the sky, or hidden on top of the mountains, as stated by [Avenger Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm): `heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a ... mountain`.

- [Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace)
- [Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary), apart from being similar to Royal Jelly Palace, has a few instances of large carved monolyths found across the floatig islands' ruins.
- [Candlestick Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep) or [Owlite Academy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite) has in a few instances large coffins spread across the connected grounds identical, to ones of graveyards. Scarlet fortress in particular has a lockdown map called `Fortress` with large presence of torn pages and bookshelves similar to libraries of Candlestick Keep, notably ones found with accomapnied presence of Black Kats.
- [Moorcroft Manor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcraft_manor) in great capacity is reminiscent of Candlestick Keep, and has a separate most east area for stone coffins.
- [Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand), or rather, [arenas](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arena) in general, all have a unique red and brown tapestry, yet possessing architecture of Scarlet Fortress.

Due to attribution of Candlestick Keep to Owlites, here we can identify distincly Owlite architecture, or at least one associated with Owlites, by the idea of them inhabiting those strucures at some point. There is Owlite Academy and adjacent locations, which, given architectural similarity, might likely be related to Owlites and more prominently a _single civilization resposible for construction of those castles_. Part of those locations has presence of arrays of coffins, reminiscent of crypts.

While the precise identity of this group is unknown, apart from Owlite scenario, we have a different notion tieing with present narrative of creation myth and ancient relations, one found across all of those instances, -- as presence of depictions of [devilite-like heads](#fiendish-statues) __decorating niches of the walls__, -- accompanied by arches with dragon heads overlooking the surface of the wall. The devilite-like architectural element is _not present_ in Royal Jelly Palace, Scarlet Fortress and Cryptic Statuery, which makes it more so hidden. So, we will refer to it for now as the [fiendish statue](#fiendish-statues).

##### Almirian Architecture

- Firestorm Citadel exists as the primary example of Almirian architecture, with application of wood and hexahedronal floor pattern.
- [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum) and the greater area of an [almirian necropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds) connects architecture of graveyards to one of Almire.
- [Final Resting Place](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alone_in_the_Dark#Gate_Map) is the graveyard with a [Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)) residing in the small crypt near a large coffin.
- [Cryptic Cache](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Cryptic_Cache) is the most preserved location, even possessing reseviors of water, and depiction of a burial customs of Almire, apart from the deepest room of Inner Sanctum with the [Almirian codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum).

While graveyards are stated to exist between world: `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through` ([Information Module: Graveyard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Graveyard)), which we had proposed in their initial [analysis](#graveyards) to connect Underworld and material realm, necropolis offers a variation of that state of existence as an _entire city, capable of entering into metaphysical state of being presence between the realms_.

Yet, in the context of architecture, we are interested in the connection of Almire to the designs of graveyards. As the Citadel does not even remotely have a similar to graveyards architecture, it creates a notion, which allows us to plausibly identify graveyards as being built by a different, single civilization, separate of Almire. Yet, the context of the Legion of Almire identifies graveyards through the Inner Sanctum as creation of kingdom of Almire as long as we assume that the Sanctum, due to presence of the [codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_codex_text_Dialogue/Inner_Sanctum), is built by Almire.

At the Grasping Plateau, within one of its layouts, a __burning sarcophagus__ can be found, reminiscent of [opened burning coffin of Torin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_variant.jpg) found across the graveyards of Clockworks. Notably, this tomb is distincly simiar to its [non-burning counterpart of tier 2 of Clockworks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_1.png). Weather is is the same coffin gaining development as rank missions start to involve kingdom of Almire, we do not know.

We propose that __graveyards belong to the kingdom of Almire__. While we do leave a possibility of graveyards to be built by a different civilization, the presence of Almirian army's resting places -- as coffins, as remanants and burials -- across those grounds we interpret as most significant symbolic connection allowing for further exploration of the kingdom's narrative in the future.

##### Crypts and Undeath

Architecture attributed to Owlites -- as Candlestick Keep, and Almire -- as graveyards and its variations such as Necropolis grounds, contain crypt-like areas.

When viewed in the contxt of corresponding locations, this scenery elaborates on cultures' traditions and customs regarding perception of death and burial. Moreover, in the context of spirits returning to the mateial realm it poses a question weather return of spirits to material realm is a new phenomenon.

We are unaware, weather this metaphysical notion extends beyond Cradle, or is it localized to the megastructure, or, it had existed in the past. Given instances of reanimation, such as _Torin's coffin in the graveyard_ we suggest that _burial sites and return of spirits are not mutually exclusive_ at least at that point of the analysis.

The size of the coffins also does differ. Notably, within hall of heroes, behind [Sylvin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sylvin). This coffin is of knights' stature and size. Then, what can be said about other coffins present across Owlite Academy and almirian necropolis given their scale?

The most prominent evidence of Almire using large coffins was at the end of Legion of Almire, in the [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum) and [Cryptic Cache](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Cryptic_Cache), which _contain most preserved architecture of Almire_. There is also Torin's, warrior or Almire, [tier 2 and 3 scenario room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_variant.jpg) -- his coffin there is as large as ones found at the necropolis.

As for the graveyards themselves and Moorcroft Manor, the burials are same as of Almire. Moreover, there is a particular importance of zombies across those locations. Zombies are found within Candlestick Keep and graveyards. This is important due to the fact that [Carnavons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Carnavon) and [Slag Walkers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Slag_Walker) __possess distinct armor__. Their presence within Firestorm Citadel most distinctly _suggests at their origin as the people of Almire_.

Carnavons are also related to Black Kats, which are known to gain powers from consuming auras: `They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong` ([Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue)). Black Kats are predominantly related to the narrative of Owlite dissappearance, while being capable of summoning curse-ridden undead.

This growing network of connections through curse and undeath allows for curse to be _perceived as a centuries-old, lingering force_ whose presence was felt both upon Owlites and Almire.

Other than curse, the notion of common burial customs may further connect Owlites and Almire, unless the supposedly Owlite architecture is not of their cultural origin and construction.

#### Depictions of a Stone Dragon: Gun Puppy

While the tradition of burial and distict involvement of curse had brough together Almire and Owlites, there is a different connection between designs of Owlites' or Valkyrian castles and tortomega archtecture through depiction of dragons. For Owlites we have covered [their depiction of a dragon](#depictions-of-an-owlite-dragon) across arches of their castles, and for tortomega, they too possess imagery of a dragon, which we will now elaborate upon.

As Wildwoods are explored in the 1st tier of Clockworks, the enemies correspond in their appearances to those lesser depths. The subject of our interest is the gun puppy. Yet, its apperace must be view with the knowledge of its variants across the 3 tiers of Clockworks.

- Tier 1: Gun puppy starts with a shattered shell, a cavity with gears is seen in its body. The statue rotates on a round foundation. As the puppy fires, darker metal of its internal mechanisms is seen.

    The shell has pale green color with occasional cracks. No bolts holding together the structure are visible. Front and back legs are seen, creating an imagery of puppy sitting. Now, as it is a constructs, it is an intentional design choise to use its maw as a barrel of offensive fire in a sitting position on a pedestal.

- Tier 2: The sell has mossy green color to it, it has more cracked surface as it meets at the seams the new elements of the design - metal plates. Those metal plates have a distinct metalic appearance of gray color and large bolts fixing them inplace. The pedestal is now made of the same metal with bolts found across its encircling surface. The hole n the side of tier 1 gun puppy is symmetrically replaced with a metal plate.

  This distinction beetween metal and green, cracked texture of the tier 1 puppy, we propose, is essential to depict different material their shells are made of.

  Aforementioned metal plates are present on lower and upper jawbones of the puppy.

- Tier 3: The remeaining green-hued material is replaced with segmented sheets of metal of the same color evident by their complexity. A ridged surface appears to run through the hightof the mecganism, starting at the top of puppy's head and reaching its back. The body is predominantly covered with a ribcage-like plate, likely an exchaust mechanism or vents within the armor.

- Rocket puppies devoid of elemental damage display similar change of their armor, aprat from revealing the mechanical internals corresponding to the rocket launching mechanism.
- Elemental designs. While elemental versions present a far more complex design, we will note onto its specifics -- a more mystical design with appication of carved spirals and lack of ditincly metallic elements, which aligned them closer to less gremlin-affiliated origin.

  There is the addition of elemental essences contained above slabs of stone with spiral imagery carved into them, and placed into of gun puppies' heads -- [Red Rover](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Red_Rover), [Slush Puppy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Slush_Puppy), [Sick Puppy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Sick_Puppy), [Sparky](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Sparky)). There is adistinct lack of bolted designs and great accent on light gleaming from the seams of the shell, lightning up the carvings from within, giving them more fantasy-esque, magical feel.

For the current case, the difference in green material of tier 2 and 3 gun puppies suggests a distint composition, there in it is btittle and is already damaged, and its replacement of the same color yet distinctly mechanical.

Now, paired with the abundant presence of gun puppy statues across sky islands and Gloaming Wildwoods -- __the green-hued shell, -- is the green stone, from which statues are built__.

Moreover, in the Starlight Cradle there is an area, where 8 gun puppies surround a pathway, 4 on each side. Two of each gun puppies on either of sides are statues, the other being gun puppies.

Of course, [gun puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies) possess design closely similar to appearance of Drakon battle sprites. This dictinct apperance and now proporty of being made of stone closely alignes it with tortodrones and the rest of the motif of stone -- __being invented by tortomega, made to be constructs with stone shells, resembling dragons, and purposed to guard eternally__ _their land even after their creator had ceased_. Such description on iits own is particularly similar to themes surrounding tortodrones, which may further tie the two constructs to the same creator.

#### Presence of Constructs across Owlite Castles

Yet, the above explanation still does not provide an answer for presence of gun puppies in the halls of Owlite castles, Scarlet Fortress in particular.

It is the distinct difference between those habitations of Owlites and tortomega which makes presence of gun puppies across both regions so striking.

Yet, both are related to dragons, and more so, as we have noted earlier, Owlites castles possess certain statues of fiend-like apperance, while tortomega a deeply linked to Underworld.

<!--Weather tortodrones were present during that time - is unknown as no signs of Underworld influence were present in these castles, apart from suggested [tortomega busts within the halls](#fiendish-statues), as the tortodrones were designed with the [evil eye symbol on their shells](#evil-eye) and connected to devilites even during the time when Skylark crash-landed to Cradle.-->

Tortomega had skills to construct defenses, traps, and specific type of gun puppies made of stone. As all of those constructs are present within most of castles, notably [Scarlet Fortress](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress), we have to at some point identify the creators of this technology -- the gun puppies -- after therewere being designed after image of a dragon.

It may be argued that flying Scarlet Fortress has no connection to Tortomega, but the common and shared architecture itself suggest that somebody had to create it consistently over the construction of those castles, which, given its scale, may be the rider gods themselves.

Another interpretation is found in the modern depiction of titans through specific visual cue -- the `Titan` _gates depict a creature with a single eye_, similar to a different, far more important creature found in the Underworld, harolding the widespread presence of a symbol of a single eye.

Application of an eye for those gates is particularly interesting to us due to carvings of eyes on tortodrone shells, which acknowledges the symbol as coming from the past.

Disappearance of tortomega at some point had happened, same as dragons, remaining only in crafting materials and environment, more subtle compared to relatively distinct sequence of events which had caused disappearance of Owlites, being the Kataclysm. Coupled with the context of Underworld's presence in the Ancient Grove, Spiral Order privides a distinct and refined, yet implicit explanation of tortomega disappearance: `leading Spiral HQ to believe that the Fiends are somehow linked to the disappearance of those once-mythical beings. In order to discover what the Fiends are up to, you will need to find a way to unlock one of their Grim Gates and travel through it` ([March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission))).

<!--Based on this, as well as overall state of the castles, it is plausible that the main part of the heavenly kingdom of valkyries, with its unique tapestry and carpet designs, represented as a [tower, bastion, or a rook](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress), if [Owlite/Candlestick keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep) icon and chess theme to be considered, _belongs to a greater structure in possession of valkyries, as part of physical heavenly kingdom carved from stone, considering the size of the Scarlet Fortress alone_.-->

#### Draconic designs, Tortomega, Norse Mythology

Draconic imagery is widespread across Owlite architecture. It is similar to _Dragestil or Viking architecture, wherein dragon, or rather, serpent motifs are present in similar manner, as observed across Owlite architecture_. Dragons in norse mythology symbolize chaos and destruction, which is why they were often used to decorate Viking longships as a symbol of power.

In relation to dragons and further draconic designs, [Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary) and [Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace) have the least of many draconic features, as well as being separated from the main mass of castles, freely floating across Clockworks, uncontained within the own skydomes.

A handgun, [Raptor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raptor): `An ancient pistol imbued with enchantments designed to smite the fiendish creatures of the Underworld`, and [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) both have draconic designs, but here they are referred as _raptors and griffins_. Both handguns have piercing damage, suggesting _their targets are fiends or beasts_ meaning that either Underworld must have been uncovered at that point, or dragons, under Spiral Order classification system, may have been beasts. But, due to the descriptions, this interpretation does not fit here explicitly, despite [chromalisks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chromalisk), a descendants of drakes, are beasts.

If we to take those norse mythology inspirations, and apply them to tortomega, it may be that they are a stand-in for Jotun -- a race of giants, opposing rest of families of gods -- Aesir and Vanir of norse myths relating to Valkyries. Jotun inhabiting woods, shores and mountains, seems to parallel to tortoise and tortomega inhabiting wildwoods and possibly mountains, as well as what preceded Aurora Isles.

Such inspiration would imply a conflict between Valkyries and Tortomega, yet no evidence exists to suggest so.

Givan ancient nature of Tortomega, they may also fit into greek mythology narrative, therein they become Cyclops, retriveing modern imagery ot titans from Clockwork Gates, and within myths being ones to forge for Olympian gods the symbolically linked wepons, such as lightning and thunderbolt.

At some point in time heavenly kingedom was attacked by force with the same power of frenzy, rage and storms -- `The helm of one who defied the gods and razed the gates of a heavenly kingdom` ([Frenzy Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Champion_Helm#Frenzy_Champion_Helm)).

Spookats are remnants of Kat Tribe known to invade Owlite High Academy of Magics, meaning that prior to [Kataclysm](#causes-of-kataclysm), it was under control of Owlites, corresponding to Valkyries. Then there would not be any reason for kats to go there apart from seemingly not guarded [eternal study](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Edger):

- [Owlite Academy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite)/[Candlestick Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep)
- [Scarlet Fortress](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress)
- [Moorcroft Manor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcraft_manor)

As Kat Tribe's goal was of retrieving a particular tome, so their existence, as the harbingers of Owlite civilation's fall, would be at the near end of the more ancient period of the timeline.

With this, we are left with the only lead of the __fiendish statues__, noted at the [beginning of the analysis of Owlite architecture](#owlite-architecture).

#### Fiendish Statues

Fiendish design of busts found within castles' halls of Scarlet Fortress, Owlite Academy and Moorcroft Manor possess a few distinct design elements:

- The statue's eyes resemble the most the [devilite yesmen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman) with their circular, dot-like shape, and small pits beneath, outlining the eye sockets.
- The mouth is also similar to devilites, having a jagged appearance, potentially meant to resemble teeth -- central tooth and 2 on each side for the status. Based on [yesmens'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman#Yesman) underbite and other [devilites' overbite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman#Devilite) within the textures, the lower jaw has 2 front teeth and upper jaw has 3 with one in the middle, similar to the statue.

    Those similarities would most likely allow for identification of those statues as depictions of devilites or Underworld species close to them. Yet, fiends are thematically and narratively opposite of Valkyries, which would mark their non-hostile presence within the halls as most peculiar.

- The stone on statue's forehead resembles the [Prismatic Dazzling Gem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Dazzling_Gem), which is related to Kats through idea of battle sprites being reincarnations of past civilizations. In that case being [Seraphynx](#seraphynx), which has the same gem. The usage of term `dazzling` may further relate it to Seraphynx ability of [Dazzling Light Ray](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dazzling_Light_Ray#Dazzling_Light_Ray).

    And yet, the Kats were never seen in their pre-cursed state, with equipment such as [Kat Hiss Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Mask) being the closest to depict natural physiology of Kats, with the other candidate for their appearance being [the different coats of Seraphynx' fur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx#Reskins), which we will discuss [in the corresponding chapter](#seraphynx-and-divine-kats).

    Could it be that Kats before the Kataclysm had possessed divine aspect similar to Valkyries?

But, as seemingly no devilites were encountered at that point in time -- when the castles were built, -- this architectural development could come later.

Across real-world cultures, _tall forehead with varying across cultures presence of jewelry signifies wisdom_. This characteristic can be applied both to dragons and devilites, as both may be presented as wise, in different dimensions, and cunning in case of devilites.

Depending on the intention and relation to Valkyries, the statues may provide a sence of danger, alarm, or gratitude -- as enemies or benefactors or allies of Valkyries.

As we keep those vague pointers in mind, we will attempt to identify those species and create a thematically fitting narrative as the reasonable explanation for their presence.

##### Scenario 1: Statues of Devilites

The anatomy of the jaw and eyes serves here as the anatomical, unaltered foundation for those species' identity, distinctly devilite, or at least originating from the Underworld.

If coupled with the present atmosphere of Owlite Academy, the thematically nefarious nature of those species seems fitting, taking shape of "omnious looming statues of forgotten entities alinged through unlit halls of the castle of a gones civilization."

Yet, there are a few issues with this explanation, not contradictive but expansive:

- Known devilites do not fashion themselves with trinkets or jewels present on statues.

  Statue's depiction of deveilites may come from a time before Undercorp could have been established in a modern setting of a corporation (`The office minions of the Underworld are a disgruntled lot, attacking any unauthorized personnel on sight. While not terrible threats on their own, they can become far worse if one of their Pit Bosses gets a hold of them` [Devilish Drudgery - Information Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Devilish_Drudgery)). This interpreation gtants depth to Underworld's history and deveilites culture.

- If statues are of devilites, then it would seem peculiar for Valkyries to build them, notably near the crypts of Moorcroft Manor.

  While for titans, which will later [cooperate with devilites](#arrival-of-undercorp), it would seem more fitting, as valkyries are not connected with shadow damage and Underworld until much further in the timeline we propose. And, as no Underworld was yet discovered, and valkyries do oppose it (`helmet whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` - [Valkyrie Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm)), this seems as an inexplicable design choice.

  We consider this scenario as all of those locations lasted the most, as they are populated by Spookats -- evidence of Kat Tribe's presence, -- invading those locations, meaning that Owlites were originally there, as we will discuss the relation between Kat Tribe and Owlites.

  And at that, far later point of the timeline, heavenly kingdom would've encountered devilites. Carving them within their halls may be a symbolic gesture of a [yet-to-happen Valkyrian onslaught into the Underworld](#war-of-heavenly-kingdom-and-underworld). But, this speculation does not yet have any solid arguments to be justifiable.

The presesnce specifically in the Moorcroft Manor around the coffins may frame those statues as _the guradians of the deceased_, native to the Underworld. This seems as a valid suggesion, one, which would allow for __Valkyries to acknowledge the natural order of reality__, where souls are intended to travel into the Underworld, thus _framing devilites as the cosmically essential executors of souls' lifecycle_.

Such explations seems most organic in that case, is it incorporates the older culture and relation between underworld and the rest of reality over the existence and metaphysicality of souls, potentially even before any notion of spirits returning to the material realm.

##### Scenario 2: Statues of Dragons

If statues are of dragons, then it would be a different depiction of them, -- with a greater emphasis on the Underworld's anatomy and physiology reflect in dragons, which would contradict their common depiction.

There is a shadow variant of drakon, implying dragons of frenzy to be associated with shadow damage, yet, their appearance does not differ from other dragons given the presentation and their regoniztion as dragons in the [creation myth](#creation-myth-dragons-as-cosmic-progenitors) by corresponding items.

##### Scenario 3: Statues of Tortomega

The tortomega scenario emerges from the initial designof toerdrones' faces. While they are differents, whithin the interpretation of them being designed after tortomega -- descendants of drakes and tortoises, what facial features thet could've possessed?

The key element is the [dazzling gem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dazzling_Gem) jewelry. If those castles were carved by Valkyries, it would mean that dazzling gem as a tangible object, was placed upon those creatures in means of chracterizing them in a way.

The dazlzing gem is inherently related to Seraphynx: `The ray of light deals extra damage to undead and fiend family monsters` ([Dazzling Light Ray](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dazzling_Light_Ray#Dazzling_Light_Ray)), while the ray of light itself is characterized as `Fires a concentrated beam of light that damages anything passing through it` ([Ray of Light](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ray_of_Light)).

If dragons are depicted through the designs, why would not those species, devilites or tortomega be also acknowledged in the designs by their power or position, which does not contradict their nature as the opposition?

One suggestion stems from an idea of mythrology-inspired connections of Valkyries to the source material, specifically, the notion of impossible construction, such as carving worlds from stone and the scale of Scarlet Fortress, as well as the scale of Clockworks in the modern narrative.

This narrative is embodied the closest in the myth of how Asgard of the norse mythology was build -- with an assistance of giants:

<BookCitation source="Asgard - New World Encyclopedia">

  Describing the red band in the rainbow, the Prose Edda suggests that "that which thou seest to be red in the bow is burning fire; the Hill-Giants might go up to heaven, if passage on Bifröst were open to all those who would cross." This, the constant threat of invasion by the hostile giants (Jotun), represented a genuine fear for the Aesir.

  ...

  In the mythic texts, the Aesir are thought to have constructed Asgard at some point in the mythic past. As Snorri suggests, "In the beginning Odin established rulers, and bade them ordain fates with him, and give counsel concerning the planning of the town; that was in the place which is called Ida-field, in the midst of the town. It was their first work to make that court in which their twelve seats stand, and another, the high-seat which Allfather himself has. That house is the best-made of any on earth, and the greatest; without and within, it is all like one piece of gold; men call it Gladsheim."

  ...

  However, once these various homes and meeting halls were completed, the Aesir realized that they were relatively susceptible to attack. Fortuitously (or so it seemed at the time), a giant stopped by and offered to construct them an impregnable wall and a gate to protect their fledgling realm. However, his terms were quite steep, as he wished to receive in payment the hand of Freya in marriage, as well as the sun and the moon. The Aesir agreed to this bargain, on the condition that the work be completed within six months, and that he do it with no help (as they assumed that such a task would simply be impossible to complete). The giant stone-wright agreed to this once Loki convinced the Aesir to allow him to use his stallion to help in the building process.

</BookCitation>

This cosmology of heavenly kingdom, material realm, and of Underworld with the Blinding Abyss seem to match here the general basics of norse mythology - Asgard as home of the Aesir and Vanir clans, Midgard being the realm of mortals, and frozen over underworld known as Niflheim.

Yet, despite the similarities it remains a speculation, as no distinct presence of tortomega was established in this framing of contruction, other than stone-shelled constructs.

The facial anatomy being the closest to devilites also does not allow for a varierty of interpretations without leaps of logic. Due to this, we propose so far a simpler explanation of __deveilites' culture being honored by Valkyries__ as it is desribed in the [1st scenario](#scenario-1-statues-of-devilites), as _our working assumtion for statues' identity_.

This interpretaion would establish a lasting history and awareness between Valkyries and Underworld, as ones of the most ancient civilization in the timeline, _recognition of their cosmically-defined roles_.

#### Lumbers as Constructs

On the note of constructs connected with nature, such as gun puppies, [Lumbers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber) may be identified as a non-tortomega invention. They are more crude in their construction, they have curse-like or [sealed sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword) __seal placed upon them__ instead of being carved, compared to [corrupted tortodrones' shells](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone).

While this depiction of imagery of an eye is different, it suggests a great techonoligcal gap between two inventsions -- wherein gun puppies naturally incorporate runic, spiral designs and stone exterior with overflowing elemental presence, -- lumbers immitate that fusion in a more primitive manner through, potentially, sealing of elemental essences.

Due to the notion of deveilites carving their sigils on tortodrones' shells, unknown party's drawn curse sigil on Carnavons' shields, but also gremlins' subtle incorporation of curse imagery which we will cover later, the imagery of a sealing symbol, herein being an eye, is one, we propose, inseparable from its roots in human culture and mythology. This symbol is tied with presence of shadow damage and curse in Spiral Knights, which makes us think of the symbolism of an evil eye, or a malevolent inverse of hand of Fatima (🪬).

In terms of the technology itself being used during creation of lumbers, paper seals, we propose that gremlins are responsible for engineering of lumbers, while devilites may provide the initial technology on a selective basis, as only elemental lubers, excluding Ironwood Sentinel, possess the seal.

Here, the context of Undercorp and gremlins connection must be acknowledged: `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` ([Work for Idle Hands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands)), as it provides the foundation for such line of reasoning -- for gremlins to possess knowledge of seals and their application through a selected method.

#### Howlitzers, Dragons, and Drakes

Among the more ambigious traces of Valkyries' relation with dragons is found in [howlitzers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Howlitzer). They are present within regions mostly populated by the undead, Owlite Academy, and Wildwoods.

Holwitzers possss a reptilian anatomy and jaws similar to [fiendish statues](#fiendish-statues), which is likely a stylistic choice to depict bare teeth on skulls, similar to zombies, 2 horns at the back of their skulls, depending on their tier, like [drakon battle sprites](#dragons). Those similarities make them seem  to be reanimated remains of drakes or potentially dragons.

Due to [creation myth](#creation-myth), we would naturally perceive the original dragons being far larger than a howlitzer or a battle sprite in their stature in order for creation myth to be valid in a general understanding of cosmogony.

The act of spirit returning to the material realm may exlain their reanimated state, but it does not elaborate in the reason, why their dormant up to that moment remnants were spread across Valkyrian architecture and Wildwoods, a territory of tortomega.

In order to assess Howlitzers' nature, we may look at the equipment, representative of those species and howlitzer's anatomy:

- The [Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield) possesses _rounded corners_, while its upgrades -- wyvern and dragon shields, -- have more edge to them, reminiscent of spikes along the back of drakon. The rounded scales are described to be `stout`: `A solid shield shaped from stout scales` ([Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield)). The upgrades, as wyversn and dragon shields, both possess spiky scales -- this property is seemingly acknowledged in the [Wyvern Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield): `A spiny buckler forged from beast chitin, providing ample resistance to both heat and venom`, as `spiny`.

  The relation to cold of wyverns is also found here, as they are resistant to heat through the distinctly ice-like design of the shield. This motif of termperature for wyverns is acknowledged in the corresponding helmet: `Made from the scales of rare Clockworks beasts, this sturdy helmet is resistant to even the highest of temperatures` ([Wyvern Scale Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Helm)).

  A similar design pattern -- a lack of sharp spikes, -- is seen in the [Drake Scale Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Helm). Due to this, we may consider general interpretation of drakes compared to that of dragons or wyverns as _less characterized by their aggressive design_ in the same relation as designs of drake gear are comapred to one of dragon.

  As statues and gun puppies depict wingless, terrestia, tailed creatures, we would consider them drakes, yet, the equipment does not find its design elemnts reflected in those creatures, which may be a false lead, or, dragons and wyverns had possessed a more pronounced aggressive anatomy.

- If we consider that _drakes to dragons had to be undead in order for howlitzers to appear_, then gun puppies and other statues, as well as depiction of dragon for Valkyries had to be recorded in order to preserve their appearance across different cultures.

  Dragons on their death should have affected the environment within current theory, but at the same time, howlitzers are considered undead and found across Cradle similar as spookats, _meaning that something had to bring them back at such scale_. The only powers known to be related to undeath, and capable of causing undeath, as it will be later seen, and be related to afterlife, are devilites of Undercorp and powers of curse. Those will be analyzed accordingly.

  If we consider such exitence abnormal, draconic descendants which would become howlitzers would populate those locations, including Owlite and tortomega grounds. Or, they were buried in those locations, weather or not it was intentional.

  If howliter were alive during that time, their capacity to be present across the supposed _heavenly kingdom would imply their ability of flight_, linking thim to wyverns but not drakes.

- Howlitzers have a nose horn, which is not seen across dragons, apart from _a specific Drakon evolution_, if we take existing dragon designs.

  If we consider chromalisks being descendants of drakes, then drakes would be in between dragon anatomy and chromalisks', and among them one particular species is of greater interest to us -- salamanders. Only [salamander](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chromalisk#Salamander) and [later salamander mask's alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Salamander_Mask) have _a distinct nose spike_.

  In this contex the comparison of darkon to dragon and their phsysical depiction across both tortomega and Valkyrian caultures, presence of nose horn, would frame howlitzers as related to this lineage.

  This implies a more solid link to identifying howlitzers as ancestors of at minimum salamanders, which presents us a possibility of aeial wyverns and terrestrial drakes, apart from dragons themselves.

There is death animation of tier 3 howlitzers, which home in and self-destruct on the knight in the last attempt to defeat them. While a hypothesis, but given short roster of identities, we would consider this capacity of temporary flight unrestricted as an argument in favour of their living nature as airbourne.

If heavenly kingdom is physically located above ground, as Scralet Fortress, then _gun puppies would represent stationary units incapable of flight due to their inspiration from drakes_, flying howlitzers would inherit their aerial nature from _either dragons and be identified as wyverns_.

While we are unaware of the role of dragons for Spiral Order, the sharp design of wyvern or dragon-inspired gear and mythical framing of dragons, makes us to poposes howlitzers as either dragons or wyverns, with _wyverns being fit for species without cosmic influence onto reality_, preserving that role for the creation myth as associated with dragons.

### _Chapter `V` &#160;<br>_ Spiral Order

Spiral Order is established as a military organization with charecteristic elements of their past spread through main story and equipment descriptions. Through those items this civilization's supposed homeworld and name are revealed.

Spiral Order supposedly originates from a planet called Isora, them referring to themselves as Isorans:

- `A commemorative helm that pays tribute to the countless brave Isoran guardians that have protected spacefaring crews in their adventures across the stars` ([Galactic Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Galactic_Guardian_Helm)).
- `A special saber used to resemble Isoran spacefarers of old as they sliced across the night sky` ([Celestial Saber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber)).

Through those items Isorans are framed as formidably ancient, capable of long-distance travel civilization. This framing is further affirmed by the near-fantastic designs of the gear presenting not physial appearance of an Isoran but a dense starlit sky, contrasting _grounded designs_ of the gear transmuted on Cradle during rank progression.

A certain presentation of Spiral Order is offered when this period of time before Cradle is discussed. There is appliaction of a term `eons` as a time measurement relative to Skylark crash-landing on Cradle: `This suit was once worn by Isoran starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)). Spiral Order is not referred explicitly by its name:

- `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` ([Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis)) -- Aegis's description can be interpretad in multiple ways. `Order of old`, given context of Spiral Order, is the most distint presentation of that order, one that could potentially be a predecessor of modern Spiral Order.
- `A special saber used to resemble Isoran spacefarers of old as they sliced across the night sky` ([Celestial Saber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber)) -- the term `Isoran spacefarers of old` does not identify an order as in the previous item, yet application of this term within context of a weapon suggests a presence of organization. Existence of a saber implies a potential inspiration behind Isoran past military tradition.

The theming of [Equinox prize box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spring_Equinox_Box_2016) _lacks any danger or implication of conflict_, contrasting a recent and _potentally frantic_ search for energy source due an ongoing Morai conflict. This non-hostile terminology, coupled with the present dream-like theme emits a sence of _unburdened by external factors potential_, which is a powerful tool used here to create a sence of distance only bridged by a momentary recognition: `The Strangers pause at the equinox to recognize the brief moment of cosmic balance on Cradle. For just a breath of time, there is harmony between night and day, the sun and moon, and symmetry in the celestial sphere` ([Balance of the Equinox!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178)). The prize box and its items are charactarized by a remoteness of that state of freedom, interwoven with a sence of _longing for that period of time_:

- `A special saber used to resemble Isoran spacefarers of old as they sliced across the night sky` ([Celestial Saber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber)).
- `This suit was once worn by Isoran starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)).
- `A special suit built to commemorate Isoran starfarers of old. With this equipped, you feel like you would never get lost in space...if only the Skylark could fly` ([Celestial Nav Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Suit)).
- `A special helm built to commemorate Isorian spacefarers of old. With this equipped, you can see a clear path across the night sky to countless worlds beyond` ([Celestial Nav Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Helm)).

Conventionally, eon is greater than a thousand of years, a millennium, usually reaching up to millions of years. This concept of an organization preceding Spiral Order of Isorans will be kept in mind until further development, and we will observe it in relation to other ancient civilizations.

It may be argued that the framing and narrative of celestial gear and [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box) _poetically hyperbolizes_ both the scope and scale of Isoran history. This proposal has relevance to the analysis as we will discuss other arguments in favour of implied expansive Isoran history and against it.

Further analysis will make its major goal to establish a timescale at which we could place modern Spiral Order and greater Isoran civilization and their development in relation to the rest of established reality.

#### Draconic Motif for Isorans

Further establishment of a precise time period when Isorans became a spacefaring civilization, is unknown. Despite this, we can gather a few hints pointing in direction of their development.

The [Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm) description, apart from the shared guardian motif, states: `the technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret`. Awareness of dragons has its own implications.

Scales suggest physical presence of dragons, meaning that Isorans had encountered dragons at some point, whether it was within confinements of Isora or during their `extrasolar` expeditions.

_Cradle is not framed as a planet possessing a lasting relation with Isorans_, apart from ever-present imagery of a spiral, due to lack of recognition of its civilizations or cultures, which otherwise might have been related to Isora or noted upon by them. Of cource, there is Almire, which was not acknowledged from the very beginning of their narrative. And contrasting to Almire, gremlins possess a distinct introduction: `The Clockworks seems to have been built by 'gremlins,' a furry race of malevolent monsters that have not taken kindly to our presence` ([First Contact - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/First_Contact)).

This framing of Cradle as a distinctly separate planet, albeit on the extreme end of its semi-artifical nature, we would so far propose, allows for a more grounded interpretation, where __dragons would inhabit Isora__, otherwise we are offered with a more fantastic narrative. For now we will assume that dragons were present on Isora, wherein Isorans have discovered and utilized their scales, _valuable enough to incorporate them into elite armor_.

In that regard [Azure Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Armor) -- `a grand set of armor commonly donned by the leaders of the Spiral Order`, and [Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm) -- `the technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret`, incorporate this rare material.

This correlation between rarity of the materials and gear they are used in within the context of a military organization, Spiral Order must be analyzed through a lens of inspirations used to create current theme of Spiral Order, that is, _military traditions and culture_.

At the [Sunset Steppes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes) Rhedon mentions that [drakon battle sprites](#dragons) look similar to dragons: `They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons`. This implies that members of Spiral Order did know prior to crash landing on Cradle _how dragons had looked in their appearance to be recognizable_. Weather those dragons were extinct on Isora, or their presence was rare, the impression formed by homeworld culture has persisted into modern day Spiral Order as draconic imagery or a motif:

- `Armor once worn by a member of the 'Iron Dragons,' a squad of fearless knights that specialized in the elimination of high-profile Morai targets. After disbanding, their surviving members were united with other squads by Desna to form the Recon Rangers` -- the [Gold and Iron Dragons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Armor) are military units. It suggesting a symbolic weight to a dragon as a creature.

  This means that Spiral Order had taken dragons, either as a created myth or by observation, for a naming paradigm in their military structure.

  Such naming convention is usually utilized to symbolize specific characteristics of said animals in the context of warfare.

  In that same regard, the animal motif is also found in:

  - [Hazardous Hedge Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Hedge_Coat#Hazardous_Hedge_Coat): `A battle-ravaged coat worn by the squad leaders of the Scarlet Scouts, nicknamed "hedges." The name was likely coined due to their incredible flanking abilities or perhaps it is a reference to the spikes that adorn their armor`.
  - [Dangerous Hound Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dangerous_Hound_Coat#Dangerous_Hound_Coat): `A battle-ravaged coat worn by the squad leaders of the Recon Rangers, nicknamed 'hounds.' The name was likely coined due to their incredible tracking abilities or perhaps the fact that they fight like wild dogs in battle`.

- `Mythical armor crafted from the scales of a creature of legend` -- [Dragon Scale Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Mail) calls dragon as a `creature of legend`, as if they were in fact extinct, being preserved through language, image and idea.
- Interface of the battle sprite has a distinct facing to each other dragon heads with an item slot located between them.

  Dragon images remain reflected within Isoran culture, -- not their architecture, but armor, as Spiral Order is the primary lens through which Isoran civilization is presented.

This framing of dragons as creatures from legends of myths coexists with the narrative of dragons being extinct while their modern appearances through of dragon-like species are acknowledged with high precision, to the point of _their depicted apperances remaining identical to ones of tortomega drakes and Valkyries_. We propose that __Isoran civilization is old enough to witness dragons first-hand__. Whether Isorans are responsble for dragons' extinction is unknown.

#### Juxtoposition of Two Genres of Speculative Fiction

As dragon scales are used in production of Isorans gear, we could suggest that dragons were hunted as a reason of their rare presence on Isora. This would conflict with our proposed narrative of Valkyries waging war agains dragons during creation myth, framing the latter, __as a localized process rather than a stage of cosmogony__.

If dragons were hunted by Isorans for their scales, it would restict the creation myth and Valkyries as a narrative to _a finite physical and narrative volume_, a setting, of either Cradle or other planet preceeding it.

Otherwise, we could perceive rare nature of dragon scales from a perspective, where population of dragons on Isora was already low because of the Valkyrian plot against dragons.

At that point, presence of dragons across Isora would suggest that the initial proposal of Valkyries being ones to wage war against dragons might be false. For this, we will appeal to a following ide rooted in themes.

Among civilizations which possess a narrative of a long history as an important element of their identity and concept, Valkyries are the only civilization, which has _attrubites of a myth within their presentation_. Compared to Valkyries, neither Isorans, Tortomega nor gremlins _possess a connection to classic mythology at such depth_, described in the initial analysis of their motifs not as Owlites, but a heavenly kingdom.

Within this context Isoran _narrative of science fiction or a space-opera_, simialr to one of gremlins and Clockworks, sets a modern view of reality not through myth but a interpretation of physical laws gameified and fictionalized.

Within this juxtopostion a paramount element will be later discussed -- a __synthesis of old-world cosmogony through myths and alchemy, and a narrative of soft science fiction of a space opera__.

We offer a compromise which will allow us to negate this thematic conflict -- wherein presence of dragons on Isora is separated spacially from events of Valkyries, while dragons preserve their essential proprty to shape reality, reminiscent of mythic forces of nature personalized.

Such interpretation would require to analyze Isoran history on matters of dragons' effects on Isora wherein such effects might be noticed, without removing their integration into Isoran culture posthumously or not.

#### Isora and Dragons

Dragon scales are found across Clockworks' beast-themed depths, suggesting dragons' presence in Cradle's past, or at least one carried by the incorporated landmasses and one connected to tortomega and Valkyries.

Yet no dragons were encountered on Cradle physically. This allows us to derive from the fact dragons thought to be an extinct ([dragon scales](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale)) two interpretations:

1. Spiral Order believes with no subversion of the narrative that dragons _are extinct_: the fact dragon scales are found in Clockworks means that they did inhabit Cradle up until the time before Skylark had crashed -- that there is a population of dragons yet to be found.

   It is important to note that the method dragon scales are found -- as an item drop from enemies found in their according stratums and region -- implies dragon shedding the scales or perishing. Among those thow interpretaion a less complex scenraio -- of dragon perishing would be prefferable.

   Presence of those materials would mean that dragon scales are consumed and they are in possession or collected and being spread across Cradle by its wildlife. Dragon scales may be that widespread, if a particular event would be at a cause, such a mass extinction, returning to the idea ofdragons being hunted.

   We must be kept in sight as a 5-star material, a rare material, found at lower Clockworks' depths from beasts specifically, or potentially alchemized from [Primal Sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens): `A small wisp of the essential spirit of nature. It is of extreme value to the Spiral Order`, suggests a strong connection with nature or a natural order.

2. Spiral Order's beliefs of that dragons being extinct are proven to be false by greater reality of Cradle beyond game's scope.

  The primaty argumenr in favour of this interpreation is still found in the description of a [dragon scale](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale): `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature`.

  The animalistic imagery is also prevalent for [Padded Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor) alchemy tree, as grizzly, firefly, snakebite, or falcon.

The scales are used in military, of high ranking armors. Considering the ongoing war with Morai, source of such material would possess a strategic value.

From those elements:

- Presence of dragon scales on Cradle, lack of physical presence of dragons on Cradle;
- Dragons existing on Isora in the past;
- Perception of symbols as of draconic appearance;
- Large accent on the legend of dragons;

We propose, dragons had existed on Isora up until a certain point in time. Then, dragons would become extinct either due to Spiral Order hunting and harvesting their scales or disappearing due to a threat of being subjected to extinction, __framing the creation myth as restricted to a single celestial body__ of a planet preceeding Cradle, from which civilizations of Valkyries and tortomega came from.

#### Introduction to Isoran Culture

Then there is an animal-themed naming conventions across internal structure of the Spiral Order, preceding Recon Rangers. This is one instance seems more direct in comparison to the rest, as derived from real-world military tradition, unit, and division naming conventions.

Among them, Viking are of greater interest to us due to presence of Raiders. [Raiders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box) bear same Spiral Order insignia of a spiral warden, depicted on the prize box and shield (`A light wooden shield that blocks basic attacks and allows a countering swift strike` - [Raider Buckler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Buckler)), implying a longevity of this symbol.

Those warriors are associated in popular culture with animal names and symbols, but also rage, as berserkers.

While the general relation may not lead, currently, to any direct conclusion, what seems more plausible in this context, is the potential _celtic origin of Spiral Order_. Within this observation, symbol of a spiral is also recognized, primarily on [Raider Tunic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Tunic), varionts of which preemptively establish a link between term `firestorm` and fire or ash (`Treasure is at your fingertips and ash in your wake with this soot laden coat` - [Firestorm Raider Tunic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Tunic#Firestorm_Raider_Tunic)). The design of shoulder pads for riders so far into the past, with no modern technolgy suggests that _symbol of a spiral is incorporated into the designs, as deeply integrated into past Isoran culture_.

Spiral Order armors and uniforms resemble cultural image of central to western european armor prior to 15th century, apart from more directly modern instances, such as [padded armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor) without its 5-star upgrades (such as [Sacred Sentinel line of armors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Snakebite_Sentinel_Armor)).

This allows for a room for _5-15th century Europe military structure, customs, designs and organization_ being utilized as an inspiration for Spiral Order, __in the form of medievalism__ -- as Spiral Order incorporates those medieval elements from distinclty differnt centuries, [Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm), [Sacred Wraith Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Snakebite_Wraith_Helm), or [Sacred Shade Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Snakebite_Shade_Helm) into a unified system, all emerging from distincly different cultures and environments now within a futuristic setting.

Within whis fantasy context existence of dragons may be viewed as part of Isoran civilization, wherein danger of dragons was acknowledged, prompting Isorans to incorporate their image into multiple areas of their culture.

#### Utilitarian Alchemy

There is not a lot information about Spiral Order history in relation to alchemy.

At that, [Mighty Cobalt Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Armor) is stated to be `An advanced set of Spiral Knight armor skillfully crafted using the most recently deciphered Clockworks technology` ([Mighty Cobalt Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Armor)). By preceding Azure Guardian armor, Azure Guardian armor itself then might have be considered as one _engineered or created only as late as on Cradle_, paralleling in than notion [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis): `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear`.

Considering that Azure armor is granted to most valuable members of the Spiral Order, we suggest it existing at least before Skylark had crash-landed on Cradle, - but the alchemy path prior to it remains unchanged -- _an alchemy, which transmutes given materials through a vague, as vague as medieval alchemy, recipes, into a desired results_. This idea, we propose, is at the the root of the theme of _alchemy being utility-oriented_, rather than its real-world counterpart, being a reflection of subjective context onto the external objective Here, it is achieved through recipes, which in the context of a spacefaring civilization (`A special suit of armor designed specifically for knights on first recon of alien planets. This rugged suit protects against a variety of harsh elements` - [Tri-Guard Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tri-Guard_Armor)) would be most valuable, as they, by that logic, serve as blueprints for equipment without preestablished, highly technological base apart from alchemy station itself and correspnding materials.

To go with this concept of utility-first alchemy further, this approach allows for manufacture of highly advanced gear in an area which is not well covered or adapted by Isorans, that being Cradle.

Due to this, due to the knowledge of energy, of alchemy, of a preexisting hierarchy within Spiral Order, those factors seems to suggest that most of the equipment themes -- not the equipment itself, apart from carriers of the core themes, such as Azure Guardian Armor, -- are native to Isora, and only through alchemy those are adapted by application of materials, found on an alien planet.

Due to convenience of alchemy within this explanation would justify mainly symbolic relation of materials and resulting equipment -- as alchemy, by its real world-inspired origins and as _an emerging principle from metaphysical laws_, -- would allow for such interpretation to be valid from the perspective of the source material.

If alchemy belongs to Isorans, then who had introduces it on Cradle? And if alchemy is strictly Isoran technoloy, then would not it make [alchemy stations](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_Station) their invention? Apart from regular alchemy stations, there are [Mysterious Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mysterious_Alchemy_Machine) and [Sanctuary Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sanctuary_Alchemy_Machine). The latter spcifically possesses the same symbol of alchemy depicted across electronic displys of regular stations.

More so, this symbol is reminiscent of an [Orb of Alchemy](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Orb_of_Alchemy#Orb_of_Alchemy), identified by 2 characteristic golden curved frames positioned around a central orb.

Alchemy-based approach, hile emerged from the discussion of placement of some gear within the timeline, itself asks a quesion the description of [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis): `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear`: _what equipment was invented by Spiral Order on Cradle and what was already present on Cradle prior to Skylark crash landing_?

Some items may not be related as per regular crafting. Such case was presented with [Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield) alchemy paths' tree, whose stages are not places chronologically as they are presented on the tree itself. Those _items are separated temporally and historically_, a relation, which is not reflecte in the alchemy tree itself.

##### Technology, Alchemy, and Isoran Redesigns

Shield are known to have energy source, which allows for bubble-like unidirectional force field to be created as a primary protection measure -- `A sturdy Defender upgraded with its own internal energy source for more effective protection` ([Great Defender](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Great_Defender)).

Most of shields have [Energy](#energy) symbol present, likely being the energy source of the gear. Among those shields are:

- [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis) and its alchemy path.
- [Ancient Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Shield)
- [Darkfang Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkfang_Shield)
- [Royal Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Shield) and its alchemy path.
- [Drake Scale Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield), but its alchemy path lacks a direct representation of an energy symbol, remaining as a colored light dot.

For to be present on directly different civilizations, such as Jellies, potentially dragons or drakes, and ancient plates, we suggest that those are _modified adn adapted with Spiral Order technology_.

Apart from the gremlin Darkfang shield, which will be discussed within the context of gremlin civilization, _similar underlying logic_ may be applied, as discussed in [introduction of energy](#energy), to armors, as in case of [Ironmight Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail) and its alchemy path, characterized by the symbol of energy, located below neck on the armor's backplate.

It seems likely that, while inconsistent, __notion of Isoran technology being integrated into alchemized gear__, is one that allows for _items from different periods and epochs to be brought into reality_ while remaining at or even amplifying their efficiency through modern technology.

###### Isoran Designs of Almire

The case of such items being adapted can be seem most clearly for the [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire). The entities, which align themselves with the kingdom of Almire: [Almirian Shadow Guard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Shadow_Guard#Almirian_Shadow_Guard), [Carnavons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Carnavon#Carnavon), [Almirian Crusaders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader), and [Citadel wheel launchers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wheel_Launcher), have a different shape of the crest, while Spiral Order 5-star version of transmuted [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire) is the same as the [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis), a Spiral Order issued shield. But the undead entities use [Blackened Crest](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackened_Crest) design and shape, albeir slightly larger in scale.

In this context, [the restored Almirian Tapestry has angelic wings below the crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture#Doodads) at the roots of the black tree. This seems as a solid enough evidence for us to consider Spiral Order's _notion of adapting preexisting designs and technology_ through alchemy into reality, rather than unreasonable, but consistent design alteration.

Yet, we can not explain the design choice itself, as the tree roots and white wings symbolism is not particularly common, unless we are to refer what [Nature Sprite said in the Overgrown Court](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Overgrown_Court): `Yes, we nature sprites are the rain, the root, and the soil. But you are not like us. You are like the ones below. ... Good fortune, star-borne`. More symbolism may be recognized in context of [the kingdom of Almire and its relation to Nature Sprites and greater Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother), as the motif of nature is extermely accurate for the kingdom of Almire prior to its burning.

###### Symbol of Salt

As it was stated that `Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries` ([Alchemy for Beginners](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners)), we previously proposed that the convention of energy was as old as practice of alchemy, so, we can link alchemy of Spiral Order, accompanied by the concept of energy to real-world alchemy.

We propose that the candidate and inspiration to energy symbol may be a concept of salt in alchemy up to its symbol "🜔" and extended usage. The inverted energy symbol is similar to another symbol - saltpetre "🜕", a key component to gunpowder, which seem to be fitting to overall medieval-like inspiration of Spiral Order designs, and to be one used to depict powered-down turrets. Apart from it, it can represent a lack of energy, symbolized by a darker red color, relating to the same color of energy counter once it reaches `0` -- as initially mentioned during [introduction of energy](#energy).

##### Isoran Plated Designs

Lastly, in terms of adapted for Spiral Order redesigns, there is tortodrone equipment. As much as this equipment is reminiscent of concrete elements of a tortodrone, it is significantly different: the shell becomes a shield, while tortodrone's fist becomes a mountable gauntlet.

This pattern emerges when we look at [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) and [Omegaward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward), the prior of which we have attributed to tortomega, and the latter to tortodrones -- here, we believe, the naming convention, and the context of application seem to be particularly consistent in relation to a parent civilization.

We will point out a few elements of this series of armors, specifically, apart from the energy symbol on the back, there is a glowing circle at armor's belt which serves as a supposed mist energy tank, and present only on modern variants of the armor -- the alchemy path of [Ironmight Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail), absent for [ancient](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Mail) and [Volcanic Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail), which might coincidentally identify this element being another Spiral Order technology placed explicitly.

Notably, it is in the description of 3-star [Boosted Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Boosted_Plate_Mail): `A suit of Spiral Plate Mail with a supercharged internal power source. The upgrade didn't make the armor any lighter`, which makes us think of this element as the power source outside of wiki-only descriptions. The fact the armor is called boosted, in the context of the supercharge motif might point to this power source existing and for 2-star variant, the [Spiral Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spiral_Plate_Mail). We will keep this design choice in mind until the later discussion on mist energy.

##### Application of Magic

In relation to alchemy and, notably, [Owlites](), on Cradle knights have in possession vials, whose contents inflict status effects, including curse.

In the announcement of [Wizard Prize Box](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/124845) information is revealed on Owlite-sourced knowledge behind vials and their fanufacture by isorans: `The wizarding guilds, with the help of the Owlite faction, have long been responsible for helping to manufacture some of the more volatile potions used by knights daily. Spiral HQ has conjured spellbinding items to help resupply these extraordinary knights` ([Wizarding Ways](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/124845)).

If we take observe the existing research of Spiral Order into Owlites, we can find such instances as the [Eternal Study](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Edger), which further affirms this relation between magic and knights.

From this, we can conclude that the vial, and, potentially, other usable items are the result of other knight perishing in Clockworks.

Following equipment further links Owlites to theme of magic:

- `A cap for comfortable casting. Conical, but no laughing matter` (Casting Cone).
- `A ceremonial robe worn by learned masters of the arcane arts, who often leave their keys in one of the many inner pockets` (Magister Robe).
- `A fine robe known to be worn by powerful sorcerers, and this one guy Bob` (Sorcerer Robe).
- `An old dictionary that seems to have quite a few spells within it` (Spell Book).
- `They say the wand chooses the wizard, so don't let this one see your cute friend` ([Owlite Wand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Wand)).

Contrary to those items, which show fluidity in magic, there are 2 items which establish the initial relationship of Isorans with magic:

- `An exceptional handgun that fires powerful, elemental shots that many Spiral Knights refer to as 'magic missiles'` ([Arcana](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana)).
- `A powerful handgun brimming with dark energy. The Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research` ([Phantamos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos)).

This leads us to the idea of Spiral Order incorporating magic and spells into their arsenal at _greater pace and skill_ as the time had passed of Isorans' presence on Cradle.

#### Auras and Souls

Isorans have auras and, possibly, souls. Auras are mentioned a dialogue with [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue) during [Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation): `They [Black Kats] carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong`.

Cradle has property of allowing spirits return to material realm -- `Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)). The [souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul) are observed for the first time at [Blades of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen) and later in a few other locations:

- [Static souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Static_Soul) in the [Dry Docks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Dry_Dock) of [Ghost in the Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine).
- [Frozen souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Frozen_Soul).

  Frozen Souls near Amu-Sol in [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice). They are confirmed to come from Underworld, wherein everfrost had contained them, with Everfrost tower transported to material realm being demolished by Maulos:

  - `The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash ... souls into the Clockworks` ([Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower)).
  - `A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` ([Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol)).

- [Fire souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul) across Firestorm Citadel during [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay).
- [Void Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Void_Soul).

  Relating both to the Swarm and to the Void, [Void Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Void_Soul) are found in the Whitespace of the Core during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares). [Earlier](#the-void-part-1) we have outlined a concept of the Void, but in order to analyze it further, we need unserstand other instances of souls before we could attempt to identify nature of the Void.

The souls, being both related to Underworld and Apocrea, presence of [freed souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul), must be kept in mind. Entrapment of souls by Apocrea is described as: `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([Allister Danford - journal entry](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

This relation dependant on unique undeath-related properties of souls, implies their application as, potentially metaphorical, fuel for the engines, while being capable of interacting with elements, and void in particular.

##### Initial Analysis of Auras

Auras, on the other hand, are mentioned only once by [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke), while describing [Black Kats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat#Black_Kat): `They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`.

Based on those descriptions it can concluded that both auras and souls contain a medium of energy or power.

This flow of power, possibly related to the concept of [Energy](#energy) can physically change one consuming it, such being Black Kats. While Black Kats are seen directly and suggested to relate to auras, this cannot be said about Apocrean Engines. What are those engines in actuality is unknown, but, as stated by [Lost Souls within Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus), `The Apocrea are stuff of nightmares: a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life`, -- souls are framed as a method of sustenance for entities of Apocrean Realm, and a fuel for the engines, by Danford: `Within cities where geometry and madness share meaning, constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([Allister Danford - journal entry](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)). There is quote of: `harvesting ... souls for some unimaginable purpose` ([Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus)), which indirectly asks for the nature of apocrean engines.

This may mean that souls and auras are similar if not the same metaphysical elements present within Isorans or any life in general at that point.

But then [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke) explicitly mentions auras, when souls are referred as such, without assigning a differnt term to them. This may lead to a potentially different nature of auras compared to souls, unless auras are souls in the understanding of Spookats -- the Kat Tribe in their undead, cursed existence, -- which can be eventually traced back to Owlites and their research, as we will explore their civilization.

While souls were seen in the form of [Lost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul), [freed](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul), [skull-wearing](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)) as [Phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom), and [Almirian Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire), _auras were not_ directly witnessed or acknowledged by anyone to be witnessed. When discussing of auras, the first thing is the accessories, but they does not seem to be identical to implied metaphysical auras.

In the Moorcroft Manor, and in Haven, [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue) states: `black kats came out of some dark portal deep within the Clockworks and have raided the Moorcroft Archives! ... They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`.

##### Auras and Tomes

As Black Kats are found in the library-like rooms, it is highly likely that those archived indeed have the same _similar power as auras_. And a few of those books were seen to have magical properties -- ones found and placed on the [stands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Stands) in the [Moorcroft Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Prize_Box): [Cursed, Mystical and Ancient stands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Stands).

While cursed tome is affected by the curse, having similar manifestations of curse seen across many instances, and ancient tome remains the same, the [mystical tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand) is one of more interest to us: `a magical tome filled with arcane symbols, esoteric formulae, and a few particularly rude doodles`.

As this tome is one associated with the Moorcroft Archives, we suggest that it is a representation of a power existing as the basis for auras. The nature-like motif of this implied aura will be deeper analyzed with the acquired context of [Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite) mainly due to similarity of those magic arts. Nature Sprites are connected to Almire, so the kingdom will be also covered later in its own [chapter](#chapter-vii-kingdom-of-almire). This idea will be further developed in the context of [Owlite research]().

This distinction can also be searched for across real world inspirations.

In various cultures and spiritual traditions, the concepts of the soul and aura are often viewed as separate metaphysical entities, each with its own characteristics, significance and symbolism.

In Buddhism, the term `atman` as the `subtle body` of an individual -- the soul, -- it is eternal and transcends physical existence.

And yet, it is subtle, its presence is felt indirectly as omnipresent energy frols around it -- `life force`, -- `prana`. This _identified concept of a circulating life force, which is also ever-present as the aura_ that surrounds the body and represents its inner state. While the atman is considered the true, subtle self, the prana is seen as a manifestation of one's state of being, its presence, universally connected.

It can be linked to the `radiating power` of the tomes, described by [Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue): `They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`. And it is also here, Lost Souls, even when their elemental alignment is acknowledged, are present as series of abstract shapes, to some degree [reminiscent of Whitespace itself](#symbolism-of-whdow-lairs). Some souls retain their individuality, as there are even ones to haunt skulls.

To conclude, we belive, it is highly likely that both an aura and a soul of Isoran are metaphysical components, both interaction with realms beyond the material realm, but only _soul retains sentience_ after death of a physical body, capable of interacting with Underworld. Aura is attached to obejct, while soul can potentially haunt it.

Souls are sought after by Apocrea. Auras -- by Black Kats. Yet, __both are sources of power__ for those species.

Yet we can't currently outline more precise principles of their intrfacing with the rest of reality until an analysis of the [Kataclysm](#kataclysm), [kingdom of Almire](#kingdom-of-almire), and [Owlites](#kat-tribe) is performed.

##### Corporeal Body

As souls inhabit bodies, we have to discuss the latter.

In order to analyze Isorans, we have to make a distinct logical leap and assume that people of Almire possess anatomy and physiology of Isorans.

We should note of the remaining ghostly representations of Almirians which appear identical to Isorans, prime examples being [Torin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torin) and [Lord Vanaduke's revealed face](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke) without his mask.

As [graveyards](#graveyards) were [discussed](#almirian-architecture), we have suggested that large coffins belong to people of Almire, and graveyards are occupied by Almire. Same coffins are located within the castles presumably belonging to Valkyries, which we had linked with both civilization, now under a principle of a common burial custom.

At the same time, Valkyries possess many aspects very reminiscent of Spiral Order. That does not explicitly mean that Valkyries and Isorans are the same species, -- while the armor and overall themes of heaven  are seem to match to the point of referring at some points both as celestials, we would not yet make this conlusion final, as we have proposed [Valkyries to be ancestors of Owlites instead]().

Isorans are aware of concept of graveyards and do utilize it in their own culture, as seen in [Blades of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen), this being evident by the ceremonial tradition of Reverse Arms. Despite this, Spiral Order and Isorans seem to be not aware in depth of Underworld and other damage calssifications, -- implications and applications of elemental and shadow damage types.

As discussed in [crypts section](#crypts), presence of zombies as well as an entire roster of the forces compising legions of Almire suggest that they have a corporeal body made of bones.

###### Almire and Isoran Souls

As the main bridging element for Almire and Isorans similarity consists of the depictions and appearances of Lost Souls of Almire looking identical to Isorans, there exists a possibility of this similarity to be as simply explained as a design choice, restricted by game's scope, not requiring to model a significantly different design for Almirians. As the analysis takes all of the content at face value, we will continue with the prior notion onwards, while noting those questions.

At the same time, as Lost Souls are usually encountered as hostile entities of abstract translucent orbs. We wonder weather Almirians were capable of presenting themselves as Isoran look-a-likes. Non-hostile [Lost Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul) within the Obsidian Nexus and in Haven remain in their abstract appearance, while souls of Almire possess both a distinguished body, -- Lost Souls of Almire, -- and a more abstract form -- Lost Souls at [Blacktone Bridge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Blackstone_Bridge) of Firestorm Citadel possessing a [skull](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)), a feature shared with lost souls of Moorcroft Manor -- [Estavio](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Estavio) and [Hector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hector).

##### Lost Souls with Skulls

Previously we have noted Lost Souls possessing a [skull](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)). Those are seen in both Firestorm Citadel and Moorcroft Manor, suggesting that Lost Souls of Almire are the way they are depicted for a reason.

There are also [phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantoms), which are undead and capable of inflicting curse. They have the same characteristic skull with a turbulent glow. When phantom is defeated, it retreats to its more simplistic, abstract form of an ember-like entity.

Here, we must note of Lord Vanaduke's mask being of the similar nature, both as a potential lost soul bound to an object -- a mask, and one connected with the concept of curse. But, Vanaduke's mask is also stated to be his vulnerability: `Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke)). Nature of Lord Vanaduke's curse will be discussed in the according section for the kingdom of Almire. As for the rest of the concept regarding lost souls of Almire, they could be seen as such due to positioning of themselves as non-hostile towards isorans. And yet, their delivery in the dialogue implies no decoherence between their noble, knight-like apperance and intent:

- `Hold fast, traveler. You stand in the court of the Kingdom of Almire. Do you not hear the trumpets sound the return of our mighty legions? Are you not in awe of the prestigious heraldry of our great houses and statesmen? (You sense great pride coming from the fallen knight, but he says no more and stares off into the distance towards a lifetime that only he sees)` ([Shadowplay - overgrown Court - Torin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torin)).
- `Lord Vanaduke rules over the citadel now. His soul bound to some horrific armored prison. He has the citadel ready for battle at all times, believing that his kingdom is still under siege. He doesn't even realize that what he is trying to protect was lost a thousand years ago. Should you attempt to enter the citadel and manage to reach the throne room, please, end his suffering. Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return to their loved ones. And one more thing - I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress. Finding and freeing it may prove useful` ([Alone in the Dark - Final Resting Place - Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless))).

There are [Fire Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul) after Firestorm Citadel began to crumble during the events of [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay).

Lastly, there is existence of [abstracted, regular Lost Souls, which still possess a consciousness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(SotA-Haven)), such as during the events of [Shroud of Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea), while persisting in the material realm, albeit surrounded by [resurfacing Apocrean Realm as slabs of obsidian in Haven](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Haven-Event-SotA-TownSquare.png).

We suggest that the souls are the sentient souls in common understanding -- a one's sentient and eternal being, while the omnipresent energy, -- the aura, accompanies it, granting a degree of physicality, presence, which was distincly lacking for corporeal images of Almirian crusaders, and persistency in the material realm, be it a spiritual form, as of Almirians, or allowing of presence outside of a physical object. The other case is one being bound to an object, [haunting it]().

To conclude, we propose an _alternative explanation_ and a current working theory, which satisfied for now Owlite and Almiritan phenomena: __aura is a container for a soul__ -- __a corporeal body__, indistinguishable, but essential element in order to exist in the material realm. But, the closer is the soul is located in proximity to other realms, the necessity in aura as a corporeal body vanishes. _Aura anchors a souls in-place and present monent_.

- Corporeal spirits of Almirian Crusaders are auras.
- Black Kats consume bodies identfied as auras.
- Auras are not desired by Apocrea due to prior's relative nature, rather than an essential across all realms.

#### Order of Old and Alchemy

Over an unidentified period of time Isorans were exploring the space of material realm:

- `With this equipped, you can see a clear path across the night sky to countless worlds beyond` ([Celestial Nav Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Helm)).
- `A special saber used to resemble Isoran spacefarers of old as they sliced across the night sky` ([Celestial Saber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber)).
- `This suit was once worn by Isoran starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)).

We assume that items of the [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box) _describe an era prior to establishment of modern Spiral Order_. While it is not called as such, but rather as Isorans as a whole, in reference to a planet, with an advanced enough technology for interstellar travel, we will establish a colloqual term as an `Order of old` (`Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` - [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis)).

Those items reveal more technological side of Spiral Order at that point in time. Specifically, a capacity to plunge into stars: `With this equipped, you feel like you could dive into the heart of a star` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)). While a probable exaggeration, we perceive those descriptions at face value that being literal descriptions of Isoran technological achievements.

There must be a distinction or a point when Spiral Order was established. The overall roster of those items links Isorans' past to Cradle based solely on the presence of Equinox prize box and shared energy symbol, although the designs of equinox or celestial items are distinctly unique, the are common elements shared across the rest of Spiral Order equipment.

The distinction between order of old coupled with a narrative of dragons for Isorans, and a modern Spiral Order possesses an element of thematic individuality. While the latter evolves from the prior, a separation had occured, which had distnaced more fantasy-driven motifs into ones of utility -- such cases being most distinct when we have covered a perception of alchemy as a tool.

##### Celestial Shield and Azoth

The alchemical motif is also present in the celestial equipment. Specifically, in case of the [Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield), its shape possesses a duality reflected in its description: `Cradle's equinox inspired the dual nature of this specialist shield, which protects against the dazzling light of day and the chill of the night in equal measure` ([Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield)).

While the framing of `Cradle's equinox inspired` implies the creation of this shield as recent, which while contradicts the initial premise of those items being old, affirms the idea within the announcement: `To recognize this special event, Spiral HQ has created new costumes and accessories for the Knights of the Spiral Order` ([Balance of the Equinox!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178)).

The _duality or the unity of opposites within the shiled_, coupled with its shape, we propose, points to a depiction of a fifth divine element, present in medieval alchemy -- [Azoth](https://www.alchemy-texts.com/assets/img/books/basil-valentine-azoth/VA04.jpg), or the alchemical First Matter:

<BookCitation source="AZOTH or the way to make the hidden gold of the Philosophers - Brother Basil Valentin">

  O most precious & most excellent foundation, from which all things are produced in these lands, though you are at first a venom adorned with the name of Fugitive Eagle. The first matter & the white & red seed of the divine blessing, in the body of which the drought & the rains are closed, which however are hidden from the impious because of the ornament & virginal dress scattered throughout the earth; your father and mother are the sun and the moon, the water and the wine also operate in you, the gold likewise and the silver in the earth, so that mortal man may rejoice therein in this way.

</BookCitation>

While the shild whithin this interpretation exists in separation for other gear, we will look forward for the morif of unity of opposites within Isoran culture.

#### Establishment of Order: Symbol of a Spiral

At some point in time, Spiral Order had to be established. The name of a Spiral, a symbol widespread across Cradle, was utilized in Isoran military. This must be for a reason, as no any concept comes that close as the spiral -- being prominent _to the point of being reflected in the naming convention of the order itself and its gear_.

The Spiral as a symbol holds paramount meaning to Isorans and supposedly their culture, as it is depicted both as ornamen as well as a central element, the latter being, for example, [Swiftstrike Buckler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Swiftstrike_buckler).

Could this be the same notion as of mythological narratives being recombined for Valkyries and dragons, but instead of myths, Spiral Order taps into many _customs and practices of combat warfare across multiple time periods_ incorporating them into a unified practice?

#### Spiral Wardens

Near or prior to time of Spiral Order formation, [Spiral Wardens](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spiral_Warden) are established as a military unit. Their armor design, specifically the helmet, reflects Spiral Order insignia -- a horse head, the [Warden Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warden_Helm).

Both by their name and role wardens symbolize _resilience_:

- `The helm of the Stalwart Spiral Wardens is said to give great comfort to other knights. Nothing says "here comes the cavalry" like the sight of these iron giants taking to the battlefield` ([Warden Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warden_Helm)).
- `Spiral Wardens are well known for being guardians and protectors, sworn to put the safety of others before their own. Are you up to the challenge of becoming one of these brave champions?` ([Onward to the Year of the Horse!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95960)).

And yet, wardens possess a connection to fiendsh trojans of the Legion of Ur established both in their design and the [Colossal Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Colossal_Prize_Box):

- Presence of [Baleful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Baleful_Aura#Baleful_Aura).

    Trojans emit this aura, yet implications of that are unknown until we can understand the fiendish nature of trojans.

- Drop of [Prismatic Ruinous Crystal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Ruinous_Crystal).

    This item directly ties nature of minerals, its effect as _specifically_ `ruinous`, and its material, as a crystal. From that introduction we can assume, based on the atymology of the word `ruinous` as a cause of ruin, to be a potential source of ruin or an affliction.

- `If you are, you need to look the part! Through February 3rd, 2014, get distinctive Spiral Warden horse head costume items in Colossal Prize Boxes! (Or if you want a touch of corruption in your life and you'd rather look like a Trojan, you can do that too.*)` ([Onward to the Year of the Horse!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95960)).

    The ruinous affliction, whether it is due to the presence of an aforementioned crystal, is identified here as corruption.

Continuing this notion, we have yet to understand, whether Wardens were inspired by fiendish Legion of Ur or Legion of Ur is one comprised of trojans as corruped Wardens. In the same pradigm also fits _Arkus_, resembling both a warden and a trojan, whom we will discuss in relation to trojans and _Silent Legion_.

Legion of Ur or existence of Underworld in general was not seemingly discovered by Isorans, despite presence of piercing weapons. This idea is based on an assumption that Spiral Order had not encountered Underworld, as its presence would potentially lead Spiral Order to _develop specific shadow-resistant defenses_, while focusing solely on piercing and normal damage.

##### Guardian's Oath

An important component of Wardens' identity and role exists within Guardian's Oath. While it is not presented directly, it is characterized by a few characters:

- `Grantz was the real veteran of the bunch. A seasoned Guardian, Grantz specialized in keeping his squad safe, namely by crushing anything that would mean to do them harm. Grantz took his Guardian's Oath very seriously, often putting himself directly in harm's way in order to protect another. The guy was selfless. I imagine that if disaster truly befell the Alpha Squad, Grantz didn't let it end without one hell of a fight` ([The Pioneers - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers)).
- `Guardian Knight Arkus was one of the finest warriors serving the Spiral Knights until some time shortly after the crash. As one of the first to search for the Alpha Squad, Arkus's own squad perished in a grisly battle with a horde of dust zombies. Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad. Arkus now journeys into the Clockworks alone, never risking the loss of another squad and we believe, somehow trying to find the squad he once lost. As these expeditions began to appear self-deconstructive, Spiral HQ issued him a direct order to cease. Arkus ignored these orders and has gone deep into the Clockworks and has not returned. Not wanting to lose the last of his squad, Spiral HQ is asking you to pursue him to his last known whereabouts, some kind of mysterious sanctuary at depth 26` ([The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion)).
- `Heavy weapons require precise timing to use effectively and the gear tends to slow you down some. But what you sacrifice in usability is returned in sheer power. The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that your squad can depend upon to stay alive and face even the fiercest of monsters` ([Izola](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Izola)).

Guardian's Oath ties back to resiliency of Wardens and Guardians, which we would interpret given those lines, as _a set of principles -- a doctrine_, -- similar to gremlin's Iron Law, which is a far more complex matter. Based on the extreme case of Arkus, without a deep at that point analysis, we propose that the Oath demands a Warden to be the primary defense of the squad, and at the end _prioritizing preservation of the accompanied squad above one's own_:

- `The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that your squad can depend upon to stay alive and face even the fiercest of monsters` ([Izola](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Izola)).
`Grantz took his Guardian's Oath very seriously, often putting himself directly in harm's way in order to protect another` ([The Pioneers - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers)).
- `Arkus's own squad perished in a ... battle ... Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad` ([The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion)).

If Legion of Ur and corresponding trojans are ruined or corruped Isoran Spiral Wardens, what shape and principles would Guardian's Oath be twisted in at a such fundamentally different state of being?

#### Omnipresence of The Spiral

As we have pointed out a cultural and inherently symbolic importance of a spiral to Spiral Order, we should to consider widespread presence of a spiral across Cradle.

We note that we view imagery of a spiral not as artistic choice, but constant imagery found in reality of that fictional world.

Currently, it is known that the Knights have incorporated concept of spiral at some point through naming conventions and imagery. This spiral imagery is also widespread on Cradle. That is:

- Cradle's seemingly fractured Moon has a carved image of a spiral on its near surface facing Cradle.

  As the spiral is always visible from any location, during the day when Skylark crash-landed and on replica moons within Clockwork skydomes, it can be concluded with certainty that the moon is tidally locked, either through an artificial process or celestial body mechanics.

  This is a question of wheather the moon is artificial, wherein either of the scenarios has its respective set of implications. In that same regard the nature of the spiral on moon's surface is one of ambigious origin. In latter case of natural emergence of a spiral would characterize it, given this universe's laws, as a _physical law recognized through an omnipresent pattern or imagery_.

- [Wolvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver) and notably [Ash tails](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Ash_Tail) and [Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Frostifur) have spiral patten on their coats.

  A speculation for only those two wolver species possessing a spiral might be of an unnatural nature of them, a connection to [Underworld](#influences-of-underworld) and Fire Deity. But this proposal seem to fail, as we suggested an existence of a [Underworld cults](#fiendish-cults).

- Back wings of [Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite) have imagery of a spiral.
- Construct, [Lumbers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber) are constructed from a tree with spiral pattern on its bark. Same trees are seen in the [Jigsaw Valley](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jigsaw_Valley).
- Tier 3 elemental [Gun Puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Sick_Puppy) have a dark stone slab on top of their heads with a glowing carved spiral, above which an elemental essence-like object is permenently present.
<!--its a red repsawn core from emesis blue, look at the erratic irregular pulse of the spheres. Look at tf2 knight hat cosmetic from sk-->
- Clockwork tunnels' floor tiles are supposedly built by gremlins, which would mean that gremlins are aware of this concept, as they keep presence of spiral imagery consistent across the depths and tunnels' status effect themes.
- Stone monoliths within the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove) possess glowing spirals.
- Whitespace of the Core has imagery and structures resembling spirals:

  - Walkways' square spiral patterns between level sections.
  - Patterns of square spirals present on the gates - enemy gates and golden key gates.
  - Square spiral pattern is also observed within designs of [Mysterious Consoles and the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact) -- their metal lining, due to the placement, resembling a Greek key pattern of square spirals.

- Square spiral stonework patterns are seen in Haven, the occasional bricks found in rock or soil walls.

  This pattern of rare placement of brocks within the walls is mimicked in the Sanctuary within an area surrounding the Sanctuary Alchemy Machine.

- [Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle) and the rest of Aurora Isles have a unique blocks with a _glowing during the night_ spiral carved on their sides.

  The glow's color is reminiscent of [valestone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Valestone), which is used in transmutation of [Starlit Hunting Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Coat).

At that point, the question of who build the Artifact and the Core, while is of separate nature, remains, and eventually will be explored in the [according section](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks). But, this concept of a spiral must be examined as one extending beyond Cradle which requires understanding Cradle an its history first, in order to draw conclusions.

There must exist a fundamental paradigm at the base of reasoning behind Isoran military to be named with a spiral in their name. __The spiral becomes symbolic__.

The _spiral attains symbolic meaning_ not only for Isorans, but for civilizations of Cradle too, which albeit indirectly, humanizes them through shared acknowledgement of those symbols -- a more so important aspect given alien nature of those civilization within science fiction genre and speculative fiction in general.

A safe speculation can be performed, one that is based on idea of separate histories of Isorans and Clockworks: assuming that **the Spiral is, at least partially, a universal or interstellar phenomenon, important enough to be replicated in many instances, even cultures and civilizations**, -- _as sun cross was a symbol of the Sun before understanding of the Sun as a celestial body, but a deity_, -- it may be related to other illusive concepts, such as other realms or a deities -- a part of a different, omnipotent concept that remains undiscovered.

#### Morai

Morai civilization and Morai Wars are introduced as the intial, driving factor for the story, as without them the narrative of energy search and eventual crash landing of Skylark on Cradle would not be possible: `The Morai Wars have brought us to the brink of extinction. We, the crew of the Skylark, fled to the stars seeking a source of incredible power, our last hope to save our homeworld. What we discovered was beyond imagination. We discovered Cradle` - [Spiral Knights: Prologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5CrSNU-Wyg).

There are only a few members of Skylark Crew that are confirmed to fight in Morai Wars:

- [Desna and Reckon Rangers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Desna): [Iron Wolf Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iron_Wolf_Helm#Iron_Wolf_Helm): `A helm once worn by a member of the 'Iron Wolves,' a squad of fearless knights that specialized in the elimination of high-profile Morai targets. After disbanding, their surviving members were united with other squads by Desna to form the Recon Rangers`.
- [Euclid and Alpha Squad](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Euclid): `Euclid wasn't your typical knight. By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard. As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora. A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of other squads` ([The Pioneers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers#Dialogue)).

In relation to the siege of Isora [Pathfinder Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor) and its alchemy tree have specific strategic roles. From this earlier period of time, armors such as [Circuit Breaker Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Circuit_Breaker_Armor), [Frostbreaker Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostbreaker_Armor), and [Emberbreak Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Armor) all refer to an elemental core present within the armor and being hacked (`Armor with a hacked elemental core aimed at resisting fire. However, this non-standard modification creates other elemental weaknesses` - [Emberbreak Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Armor)). This suggests that at least _basic understanding of the elements, without introduction to magic of higher rarity materials was already developed_.

In order to further characterize Morai, we have to look for equipment which mentions Morai:

-[Cobalt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor) armor and [Defender](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Defender) alchemy trees have piercing defense.
- 5-star [Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker) `A deadly handgun said to be capable of sundering heavy armor with a single shot. These firearms proved instrumental during the siege of Isora in breaking through the war machines of the Morai` and 4-star [Breach Blaster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breach_Blaster) `An enhanced pierce blaster designed to break through hostile armor` are piercing damage type weapons.

This equipment comes from more recent Isoran pre-Cradle past, wherein danger of Morai is already present, while associated with properties of Morai armor and technology, suggesting their weakness to piercing damage.

##### Classification of Morai

As damage types and enemy classification systems are predefined, we can assume that those systems are also applied during pre-Cradle exploration, and specifcally, to Morai.

There are 2 scenarios to cover:

- Whether Morai are Isorans;
- Morai are a different species.

_Beasts_ and _fiends_ are weak to piercing damage, but only _beasts_ and _slimes_ can deal it. Yet there are no constructs nor armors that are vulnerable to piercing -- this is a novel concept, as it does not fit into the established damage framework, as not only Cobalt armor but armor in general is through of as one to offer protection from piercing damage.

Slimes seem to be unique to Clockworks as then their hierarchy then would not be a novel discovery to the Spiral Order, as suggested by Kora: `Apparently, monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes. These 'Royal Jellies' are enormous, selfish and ill-tempered slimes that live in opulent palaces that we can only guess have been squatted in as we do not believe slimes are capable of building structures` ([Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace)).

Could presence of Riftlocker also mean that the personnel of said war machines was the target, but not the constructs? This is plausible, but currently does not help with the identification.

If Morai are fiends, then this would certainly lead to Spiral Order's discovery of shadow damage and Underworld. While the prior is practically true, awareness of Underworld apart from Cradle is unknown. The only way we can look into Isoran understanding of Underworld is through their response on existence of fiends and lingering spirits on Cradle. Considering many different mentions of Underworld, and specifically mission description of [Whipping and Mishandling](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling): `After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within. Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins`, it seems that Underworld was discovered as it is, a separate realm, only on Cradle.

Lastly, less complex scenatio asserts that Morai are an Isoran colony.

As Isorans are a spacefaring civilization, as most directly proven by existence of Skylark, Morai are distinguished not by their species but world -- _as Isorans are identified as people of Isora, so do Morai_. As it was stated by celestial sets that explicitly Isorans were spacefaring it makes it seem as Isora was the homeworld for this civilization.

Here, as [Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker) states that `firearms proved instrumental during the siege of Isora in breaking through the war machines of the Morai`, we suggest that the distance between Isora and a supposed homeworld of Morai is close enough for Morai `war machines` to be effective.

Due to those factors we suggest that if we ever to place Morai into this entity classification table they would possess similar properties to gremlins -- bearing their insignia, as gremlins are identified in the classification system by their insignia, and being distinct in their damage types and resistances, compared to other enemy types, as, potentially, weak to piercing damage and afflicting piercing damage.

#### Isora and Cradle

As Isorans are a spacefaring civilization, we will discuss further several similarities between Cradle and Isorans in attempt to identify the nature of this relation, and subsequenly, _underlying thematic similarities and conflicts_.

##### Mythological Framing of Spiral Raiders

Raider equipment of [Raider prize box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box) has imagery of Spiral Order, of a horse head, on it, such as:

- [Raider Buckler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Buckler)
- [Raider prize box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box) itself
- Spiral imagery of [Raider Tunic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Tunic) on its shoulder pad and belt
- [Raider Helm Crest](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Helm_Crest), identified as the crest
- [Squall Caller](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Squall_Caller) possessing symbol of energy

This can be resolved it 2 ways:

1. Spiral imagery is seen in celestial equipment, suggesting that it was utilized by Isorans from very early times, during the less technologically advanced age, one inspired by northern or scandinavian cultures. This _similarity to Valkyries_ and heavenly kingdom will be kept in mind.
2. Raider equipment is not native to Isorans, but originates from the same species and period f time Almire belongs.

  - `Treasure is at your fingertips and ash in your wake with this soot laden coat`
   ([Firestorm Raider Tunic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Tunic#Firestorm_Raider_Tunic))
   - `A pristine raider helmet, save for a few dings and a thick coat of ash` ([Firestorm Raider Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Helm#Firestorm_Raider_Helm))
   - `An ornate, fiery axe favored by raiders for its versatility` ([Firestorm Skeggox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Skeggox))

  These items possess fiery or ash themes, and as the name itself suggest, are meant to be associated with the Firestorm Citadel, also including [firestorm skill](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm) of [drakon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon), which is also referencing dragons: `Summon the power of true dragon fire to burn everything in your path`.

  Otherwise the shared notion of firestorms between isoran culture and Almire would present a possibility of raiders to be associated with Almire, while Isorans have adapted wthis equipment. While this is a specualtaion, it emphasizes the importance and shared notion of __firestorm motif__, _while acknowledging similarity btetween Almire and Isorans_.

There are also elemnts of frost and squall. Weather those elements are related to original three of dragons -- rage and fire, frenzy and frost, storms and shock, -- is unknwon, yet the pattern of naming common elements differently depending on culture is also present here. The frost, while it is charaterized by mixed elemental damage [Winter's Edge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winter%27s_Edge), is associated with shadow damage through rare but [heavy theme of death](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Damage#Shadow_Damage) such as [Winter Grave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winter_Grave): `A tremendously powerful hand cannon whose moniker should come as no surprise to anyone who happens to be viewing it from the wrong end. A charged shot can even plow through multiple enemies`.

All of these items have spiral imagery, as weapons have spiral carved onto them, and costumes have spiral on their belt and other elements of equipment. Considering that dragons were a possible inspiration both for Spiral Order and Valkyries, with both containing Norse mythology motifs, -- can they be further drawn closer in _attempt to identify Valkyries and Isorans as the same species_?

##### Spacefarers of Old

The terms `spacefarers of old` ([Celestial Nav Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Helm)) and `Isoran starfarers of old` ([Celestial Nav Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Suit)) as noted earlier, sets explicit ambiguity within the timeline stemmig from [Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis): `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old`.

While Aegis is specified as belonging to order before Spiral Order, it bears same emblem as Spiral Wardens, and subbsequently, Spiral Order. In that regard, if raiders were to be interpreted as Isorans, contrasting modified appearances of Almirian equipment through addition of wings, then raiders would become one of earlier iteration of Spiral Order through common symbolism of a warden head.

In teh same manner we can interoduce the possibility of Almire to be identified as Isorans. In such case Raider would be attributed to that period of time as noted earlier in the establishment of firestorm motif. But, apart from this expansion of Almirian identity within the narrative, it would require a causal explanation -- __why would Isorans, as the kingdom of Almire and Raiders, find themselves on a separate planet__?

This question tests the timeline for causal explnation, which also is required to be thematically consistent -- offering an explanation for a shift from a generally advanced spacefaring civilization to one of medieval technology.

The thematic transition can be achievedthrough presence of Isoran-like equipment within the Iron Hulk of a spaceship during the event of [Ghosts in the Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Iron_Hulk). The mission's setting suggests that either Morai or Isoran vessel had arrived to Cradle a few hundred of years prior to Skylark crash landing there.

If Isoran or Morai vessel had already crashed twice in the span of a few hundred of years, what is the possibility of the same event to happen far earlier, aligning with the time when celestial gear was used `eons` ago?

Isorans had technology to allow interstellar travel, it is then might not be a logical leap to conclude that at some point in time Isorans did in fact arrive to Cradle and their descendant became people of Almire and the people of other 2 kingdoms, potentially including raiders. The logistics of this transition to the kingdom of Almire will be discussed in [the end of the analysis of the kingdom of Almire](#war-of-heavenly-kingdom-and-underworld).

##### Skylark

When thought of interstellar travel, it is believed that the time taken by the travel itself is considerably long, but, in case of Skylark and overall technological advancements of Spiral Order, this limitation was solved, as based on the intro cinematic Skylark has the required technology to travel those long distances near-instantly.

Based on the earlier mention of eons regarding celestial cosmetics, Spiral Order or Isorans existed for quite a while, and such technology would be then expected or at least improved to the point it is seen currently.

Based on [Feron dialogue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue): `After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source`, a fuel called tearium is used to power the engine as well as the ship itself ([Reporting for Duty - Feron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue)). Skylark has at least two sources of energy, referred as tearium cores. The other is recovered and [placed into Haven Laboratory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lab) to power it: `We managed to pull the secondary generator from the Skylark mostly intact. Unfortunately it's barely powerful enough to keep this lab running, let alone power our ship.  We'll need to find another power source if we ever hope to return home`. It is designed similar to arcade gate pillars with distinct presence of Energy aura patterns.

We can identify the potential of tearium through the analysis of the [intro cinematic](https://youtu.be/d5CrSNU-Wyg). Skylark, prior to reaching Cradle's star system was located in a tunnel, over which into cinematic narration is performed. Based on the general understanding of Isoran advancements and Skylark's appearance near Cradle, we propose that it is a tangible, physical tunnel created by the vessel for long-distance travel through tearium technology, rather than being a narrative device. In this proposed context we consider tearium as a fuel derived of "to tear", such as to tear regular space.

##### Myth-driven Similarity of Valkyries and Isorans

There are many items pointing to Isorans being _symbolically_ related to Cradle:

- The [firestorm motif](#mythological-framing-of-spiral-raiders) within Raiders' equipment as well as the low-tech and magical theming of the equipment itself.
- `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` ([Aegis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis)) -- as discussed earlier, the vagueness is intentional, which inttroduces a concept of an Order of old.
- `The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret` ([Azure Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm)) -- as it was examined in relation to [both Spiral Order and dragons](#spiral-order-and-dragons), in the current context of Isoran origins it remains relevant.
- `As it is often said, a knight need not have courage: just Valiance` ([Valiance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valiance)) has similar framing of a concept to Justice of Almire: `Law and Order have fled Almire. Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke. Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless` ([Legion of Almire/Inner Sanctum - Almirian codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum)).
- Cradle has much present spiral imagery, mentioned in the [Spiral section](#concept-of-spiral), it could be an appropriate location thematically for Knights to be related.
- Designs of [4 and 5-star alchemy paths](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Grizzly_Wraith_Helm) of the [Sentinel Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentinel_Helm) imply a different set of themes for Spiral Order prior to Cradle.
- The [Hazardous Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Prize_Box) contains items relating to Scarlet Scouts:
  - `this helm is in the visage of a demon said to have broken off its own horn to use as a weapon when it faced its end.` [Hazardous Diablo Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Diablo_Helm#Hazardous_Diablo_Helm) - a cultural presence of demons.
  - `this helm is in the visage of Death itself. Those that wear it have a saying, 'Death is at your heels, so keep facing forward'` ([Hazardous Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Grim_Mask#Hazardous_Grim_Mask)), - a personification of Death.
  - `this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` ([Hazardous Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Oni_Helm#Hazardous_Oni_Helm)) - a cultural reference to Oni inhabiting mountains in Japanese folklore, and associated with thunder, which is present here as Storm-themed gear of the [Stormy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stormy_Prize_Box), [Storm Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Champion_Helm#Storm_Champion_Helm): `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed the gates of a heavenly kingdom. Some say the thunderclaps are the eternal echoes of her siege`.
- Among auras, the [Orbit aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Orbit_Aura#Orbit_Aura) has Cradle's Sun and Moon present, held by clock-like mechanism, in construction similar materials used in the [Celestial Saber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber).

  Yet, it has imagery of Cradle's Sun and Moon, identical to one of [Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield), while the equinox itself is valued both by Strangers and Isorans:

  - `The Strangers pause at the equinox to recognize the brief moment of cosmic balance on Cradle. For just a breath of time, there is harmony between night and day, the sun and moon, and symmetry in the celestial sphere` ([Balance of the Equinox!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178)).
  - `To recognize this special event, Spiral HQ has created new costumes and accessories for the Knights of the Spiral Order. ..., and meditate on the workings of the universe. Then, refreshed, delve back into the clockworks with equipment that is out of this world!` ([Balance of the Equinox!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178)).
- More so, as much as Almirian Crusader armor is transmuted from Isoarn Azure armor as myth-driven counterpart, so is [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher), `A powerful cold iron blade forged for the singular purpose of hunting down and destroying the undead`, to [Warden's Leviathan Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Leviathan_Blade).

   In that regard we are yet to justify more fantasy-themed weapons, such as [Troika 5-star upgrades](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika#Alchemy_Path) and the [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher) line of Calibur, making it similar to [Almirian Crusader Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader_Armor) from the design of alchemy tree progression, as a derivation at a later stage of alchemy tree.

- Avenger line of swords ending with [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger) which might belong through design of glowing lines to [Heavenly set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor), but at that same degree might come from a different time, where curse was found and reversed, as seen in the sword's design itself, wherein eyes do not represent curse but benevolent force with elemntal damage type.

  It constrasts with heavenly kingdom's absent knowledge of seals and evil eye imagery. Valkyries from ealier period of time lack a notion or capacity to reverse or neutralize curse, while Owlites, as descendants of Valkyries, possess stronger relation to curse, including their relation with Kat Tribe.

If those items indeed belong to Isorans in the past, they frame Spiral Order in a light similar to one of Valkyries, as emerging from mythology and deific ancestry, similar to th _legend-like framing of the seige of heavenly kingdom_:

- `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed the gates of a heavenly kingdom. Some say the thunderclaps are the eternal echoes of her siege` ([Storm Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Champion_Helm#Storm_Champion_Helm)).
- `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed the gates of a heavenly kingdom. Some say that whistling wings are the eternal warcries of her siege` ([Frenzy Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Champion_Helm#Frenzy_Champion_Helm)).

With this notion we should point out a possibility of _Rider gods to be potentially identified as Isorans_.

Yet, Isorans lack the thematic connection with those gods, as they are _not depicted to possess element of magic_, but rather an explicit _lack of knowledge on it_. There is a window of possibility to connect lightning of frenzy, rage and storm gear to Isorans, but, when compared in exact detail, only Energy attains visible resemblence to the theme of lightning. More so, energy on its own when separated from Isorans carries this theme of power and lightning, such as the storm-like surface of the Core at depth 29 of Clockworks -- _a location, unrelated to Isorans_.

In that regard we could reestablish an idea that Isorans have adapted Valkyrian gear due to their shared imagery of a spiral, and yet, there are motifs of wings and an identity of Valkyries as guardians:

- **Motif of Wings**: Wings within Isoran culture are present even in their modern depiction, [Plasma Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Wings), in their Solar and Cosmic variants within [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box), as well as presence of wings on Almirian restored designs.
- **Guardian motif**: Isoran narrative of protection of Cradle in the end of rank missions campaign shapes Spiral Order as the next civilization to protect Cradle. Herein also the deific motif makes itself present through Sleeper as a _deity-like figure within the narrative_ of the campaign.
- **Themes of Handguns**: Handguns of [Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua) [alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua#Alchemy_Path) explicitly dissolve the boundary between themes of corresponding handguns, including dragons, while introducing weird-west genre through them, identified as _Gunslinger Priests_ faction. Those handguns introduce a deep awareness of Underworld in its many aspects, and yet Spiral Order visibly, _slowly comes to that degree of understanding only throughout the campaign_.

Given those arguments, will adhere to our primary interpretation and a working theory of Isorans remaining similar to Valkyries, but devoid of their explicitly mythological narrative. And then, Isorans -- __Spiral Order shapes itself into the image and position of heavenly guardians__ from the past through the course of the campaign.

We will explore this idea in greater detail from perspective of a narrative, where protection of Cradle becomes the primary point or _a role to uphold -- a duty_ for unrelated civilizations across the timeline.

##### Paradox of Isorans on Cradle

If Valkyries are Isorans, how would they appear on Cradle?

If the Knights were at some point on Cradle, what were the conditions of their arrival on Cradle or a separate planet before Cradle in the same period of time as Tortomega. Were knights present or directly involved into [the Lesser Creation Myth](#lesser-creaton-myth)?

There are two emerging scenarios, which we will base of Sun Silver material as a distict example of the issue.

The material of [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver) is used in Almire-related gear and Azure Guardian Armor. While Almire had existed on planet preceeding Cradle of being captured by Cradle, Azure Guardian Armor is distincly Isoran invention.

1. Knights of old order -- an `Order of old`, -- have arrived at Cradle and then transmuted their fantasy-themed gear utilizing Sun Silver present on that planet. Yet, for now we can't offer a solid argument for the difference of technological advancement before and after this suggested event.
2. Dragons and Sun Silver would be universal to material realm, dragons were of different, primordial element, as it was earlier discussed, which would give them an unprecedented power as alchemical dragons.

##### Lack of Damage Types

One important aspect between similarity of Valkyries and Israns had to be adressed -- if Isorans are as old as Heavenly Kingdom, they would plausibly be aware of Shadow and Elemental damage, but it had not happened, evident by:

- `An exceptional handgun that fires powerful, elemental shots that many Spiral Knights refer to as 'magic missiles'` [Arcana](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana) -- elemental damage being referred to as magic.
- In Hall of Heroes, [Archilus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Archilus) tells that Owlites likely discovered elemental damage an it was adapted by the Spiral Order, so it was known technology, but not one used across entirety of the Order: `Elemental resistant armor and shields are adapted from Owlite technology. Though the Owlites themselves no longer exist, their amazing elemental mastery lives on in this gear`.
- `Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research` [Phantamos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos) -- shadow damage was discovered on Cradle or very recently, before Skylark was launched.

  [Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker) and [Valiance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valiance), on the other hand, had already existed during Morai Wars.

- [Celestial Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Vortex) and [Arcana](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana) are a few instances of elemental damage in Spiral Order's history.
- Earlier mentioned [Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield) being one of a few shields combining shadow damage and piercing defenses. Herein shadow damage is associated with cold - `Cradle's equinox inspired the dual nature of this specialist shield, which protects against the dazzling light of day and the chill of the night in equal measure` ([Celestial Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield)), similar to [Winter Grave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winter_Grave) and [Permafroster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Permafroster).

This would mean that [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver) - `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky`, is ever-present as Shadow Steel.

Here we also propose that the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore) through its relation to heavens, we suggest it preceding Sun Silver, _as an unrefined ore becoming metal_.

Moreover as heavens are referred to as a seemingly different realm, although given the mythological motifs, it can be related to a physical or metaphysical location of an unknown third realm: `An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above` ([Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore)). The _celestial naming convention was repeated twice_ -- in relation to Isorans from the past, and Valkyries.

Although addressed earlier, if Spiral Order did arrive on Cradle, they must have had to be far more advanced, at least preserving qualities of celestial gear.

By presence of primordial dragons, Isorans would discover shadow and elemental damage on their own far in the past. As for Spiral Order to extract dragon scales for the Azure Guardian Armor, some traces of dragons had to exist. A suggestion we would propose here, is that _only one family of dragons was present on Isora_ - such as dragons of rage as ones most related to normal damage, and not associated with frenzy/shadow nor divinity/storms/elemental damage.

Based on that knowledge, we lean to an idea of Isorans being an extraterrestrial to Cradle species. Cradle does not have technology more advanced than of Almire or of gremlins found on Cradle, apart from the events of the [Ghost in the Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine). Cradle is not Isoran homeworld, but _its inhabitants have similar myths and folklore to Isoran culture_. It is a differnt framing of the same idea of Valkyries and Isorans being similar in their cultures at least from that perspectve of corresponding military organizations.

<!--And, relating back to dragons, on Isora there were dragons of rage, demons within mountains, mythical personifications of Death.

From Isora interstellar expansion of Isorans began, at some point arriving to Cradle, as seen in case of the [Iron Hulk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine). If celestial gear is considered, the technology of those times was advanced enough to allow existence of starships, similar to Skylark.-->

##### Padded Armor

On the other hand, in contrast to previous theme of [lack of damage types](#lack-of-damage-types), there is [padded armor alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor#Alchemy_Path), within which all damage types are present.

Based on [Woven Falcon Pathfinder Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Woven_Falcon_Pathfinder_Armor) -- `A flexible suit of armor built for mobility and interlaced with slime fibers to protect against prickly and thorny foes`, -- we suggest that those armors, as they adhere to the same design pattern, were all created in a small period of time, as potentially, Spiral Order's solution for varying dangers of Clockworks.

We arrive to this conclusion, as _slime family of monsters was only discovered on Cradle_. In this context, [Plated Falcon Pathfinder Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plated_Falcon_Pathfinder_Armor) - `A hardened set of armor made to protect against even the most voracious of monsters while exploring the unknown`, -- seem to be referring to the unknown as of Clockworks, rather than generalized unknown, given aforementioned context.

The base [Sentinel Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentinel_Armor) -- `A suit of armor imbued with the power to repel the various afflictions that knights might encounter in the line of duty`, -- refers to an elemental source, given its elemental defenses, which grants it ability to `repel`. This is similar to the [initial set of elemental armors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Armor): `Armor with a hacked elemental core aimed at resisting fire. However, this non-standard modification creates other elemental weaknesses`, with its `hacked core`. We suggest this power both to repel and resist is the same object, _a power core_.

The [Woven Falcon Sentinel Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Woven_Falcon_Sentinel_Armor) 3-star line mentions a wolver -- `A suit of armor imbued with interwoven wolver hair to protect against even the harshest elements`, -- which sets it at least after the time wolvers are discovered. Whether wolvers were previously present on Isora is unknown, as such descriptions as `The Gloaming Wildwoods is home to packs of wild beasts that have proven deadly for squads in the past` ([Shadow of the Beast](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_of_the_Beast)) make it vague.

A 4-star [Plated Falcon Sentinel Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plated_Falcon_Sentinel_Armor) `A suit of armor reinforced with gremlin plating to defend against a range of dangerous elements` further suggests gremlins' specialization on elemental damage as _elemental damage is framed here as emviromnetal, natural hazard_, rather than magic.

Finally, there is 2-star [Shade Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shade_Armor): `A suit of armor infused with dark matter that allows its wearer to shoot straight and surprise foes from the shadows`. Paired with [Plated Falcon Shade Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plated_Falcon_Shade_Armor)" `A suit of fiendish fabric interlaced with dark matter to conceal its wearer while they creep in camouflaged corners`, seems as if both dark matter and fiendish fabric were utilized after Skylark crash landing, rather than on Isora.

Due to all of those items' descriptions, we propose that __padded armor was engineered on Cradle__, despite its utilitarian design.

Otherwise, those description would be referring to current application of those armors, which would conflict with their properties -- _how specifically in the past those armors would possess special damage types, if Spiral Order is unaware of the latter_?

#### Morai Wars

It is unknown for how long Morai Wars have already lasted, but it is known that during Skylark expedition it was not only ongoing, but severely crippling for Isorans.

Several members of the Skylark crew had fought there, for example, Euclid of the Alpha Squad: `Euclid wasn't your typical knight. By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard. As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora. A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of other squads` ([The Pioneers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers#Dialogue)).

Current proposal, one that we derive from the discussion on the identity of Morai, is of another star system, containing planet or colony of Morai, is colonized by Isorans. But, this colony should not be too far for Isora to siege it: `These firearms proved instrumental during the siege of Isora in breaking through the war machines of the Morai` ([Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker)). The idea of Morai being located in a different star system can be affirmed both by [Skylark's](#skylark) identified __usage of tearium to open spacial tunnels, wormholes, to travel long distances__, and previously covered themes and descriptions of individual items found in the [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box) of long-distance interstellar travel.

Isora was sieged by Morai, which is a possible reason behind lack of energy, as Morai in that position would have virtually all planetary surface and infrastructure covered.

The total lack of energy in this war was a reason behind Skylark expedition for another energy source. This would suggest that the homeworld of Isora could not provide that energy.

##### Celestial Vortex and Weaponization of Stars

Another suggestion, one that seems plausible in this **space opera**-type part of setting is based on the [Celestial Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Vortex): `A Celestial Bomb modified with a payload of a dying sun`.

If this description is not to be considered a metaphor, then __Isorans had to witness death of a star__.

And, considering bomb's usage and naming of a vortex, being similar to [Graviton](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Vortex) and [Electron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) vortexes, the result of the celestial vortex specifically could be related to a phenomenon of black holes or, in the context of graviton nature of the setting, a different method of opening up different realms. In case of graviton, it will be Underworld, as we will cover graviton technology in [its corrsponding section on graviton technology](#undercorps-graviton-technology).

This could render Isoran system potentially uninhabitable, but also give more literal context to [Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit): `With this equipped, you feel like you could dive into the heart of a star`, as then this practice of _tampering with star would become plausible_.

The ability to create bombs of this magnitude would also give a better understanding of Morai military power, as they are compared to Isorans, and framed as _the greatest to date danger_: `Euclid wasn't your typical knight. By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard. As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora. A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of the other squads. ... After all, if you cut your teeth battling under Morai fire you could probably handle anything right? But maybe the Clockworks proved too much for even his ability` ([The Pioneers - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers)). It is known that Euclid survived: `Euclid volunteered to help The Sleeper. I'm sure he's in here somewhere battling The Swarm even as we speak` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)).

Yet, the reasons for Morai war to erupt, remain unknown. In the context of Morai and Isorans one element in particular is left, a context of the [Ghost in the Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine) danger mission and technology of battlepods.

##### Ghosts in the Machine

Depth of [Iron Hulk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iron_Hulk) is located in the [dry docks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Dry_Dock) of the Clockworks. Dry docks are build in similar manner as Clockwork tunnels and deconstruction zones, both of which are presumably constructed by gremlins and contained within their corresponding individual skydomes.

In that context, paired with the [cargo bay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cargo_Bay) and bridge-like room at the end of iron hulk behind the Big Iron battlepod, _we can identify the entire structure as a_ **spacefaring vessel**.

Moreover, uniform of pilots on the bridge is extremely similar to Isoran armors, such as [Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit), which may prove that the spacecraft belong to Isoran or, potentially, even Morai.

Why would this vessel be on Cradle?

First, we have to explude a scenario of this vessel being Skylark after its destruction, as the bodies at the bridge are said to be hundereds of years old: `What happened here? These remains look to be hundreds of years old...` ([Ghosts in the Machine - Iron Hulk - Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Iron_Hulk)). The narrative implies that the _phenomenon of haunted technology remains unknown_ at least for Reckon Rangers at that point of the timeline.

Now we can explore possible explanations for this ship's presence on Cradle.

##### Haunted Vessel before Skylark

A hypothetiocal narrative: from both warring sides starships are sent to search an energy source to assist at war. From Isora Skylark was sent, from Morai a candidate can be presented in a form of ship which became the [Iron Hulk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iron_Hulk). this latter vessel would be launched far earlier, depending on Skylark physics. As we have concluded that [Skylark](#skylark) can travel large distances utilizing a technology, allowing for creating tunnels, we can suggest that this vessel was launched far earlier in the past.

Or, if we lean into more grounded interpretation of such type of interstallar travel, it would be Skylark, for which time has passed _relatively faster_, while the rest of the Universe had moved with its own pace, accumulating for hundereds of years on Cradle. As the concept behind Skylark logic is not presented as central to the narrarive, we are leaning to an interpretation, where interstellar travel is instantaneous for any observer, removing time dilation from the narrative alltogether.

Across both cases the state of haunting by undeath on Cradle would exist at least as old as this vessel.

Iron Hulk -- the vessel, -- either crash landed or was captured on Cradle, as there are [identified dry docks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Dry_Dock) within which the vessel is placed. Weather dry docks were constructed for the ship, while it was transported at lower depths, or the ship safely arrived there, is unknown. Given hostile nature of gremlins, we would suggests that the vessel was also shot down by gremlins in a manner, similar to Skylark.

Considering sheer amounts of resources required to build Clockworks, the ship and its layout had remained mostly untouched, but rather sealed in the docks, with the cargo bay remaining as it was, the fact that it remained may point to a fact that it was a risky operation to salvage it. There are constructs surrounding the ship, which are of gremlin origin, as well presence of souls and undead, including [undead Static Dreadnaughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught).

The only reason why gremlins had to contain the vessel rather than disassemble it similar to deconstruction zones, is likely due to a greater risk introduced by the souls and gremlin vulnerability to shadow damage -- the latter _property explicitly weaponized_ by Seerus through [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution).

#### Cradle Metaphysics: Part 1

The souls, as they are haunting the vessel, are most certainly __the vessel's crew__ influenced by the same phenomenon observed in the rest of the Clockworks and graveyards -- of spirit returning to material realm, as it was explored in the [graveyards section](#graveyards).

Such interpretation of the fate of vessel's crew would fit with identification of _all zombies across Cradle as Isoran species_, while providing further detain on the life-cycle of death within those metaphysics.

Crew' state would mean that Isorans are also capable of being transformed into the undead after initial death, as explored in the [corporeal body section](#corporeal-body), as their _bones remain permanently animated by their souls most of the time devoid of consciousness_.

Then there is the crew at vessel's bridge. Their position indicated that the death was either sudden, or that they have ceased when the ship arrived to Cradle's surface, and that could be a reason behind haunting, as the undeath of Cradle is _not seemingly seen by the Spiral Order anywhere else_. At that, if such scenario had taken place, then anyone perishing in proximity of Cradle would be reanimated through __soul either returning to meterial realm or not allowed to leave it in the first place__.

Yet, no other place apart from Cradle has the tendency of undead and spirits returning, other than potential outskirts of Apocrean Realm as there are distinct Lost Souls present, meaning that the haunting had to happen on Cradle or in its proximity: `Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown` ([Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)). This would not explain presence of [static souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Soul#Static_Soul), as the presence of souls on itself is a phenomenon, which, yet again, requires analysis of _Cradle itself and its unique metaphysics revolving around Underworld_.

And then there is a battlepod -- [Big Iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Big_Iron#The_Big_Iron). Gremlins utilize battlepods in many instances, including rank missions. Presence of a unique battlepod within Isoran vessel is unconventional.

Moreover, there are wires and cables connecting entire location. While they could be explained by the fact that this is an interstellar vessel, this argumant does not explain battlepod itself, as well as it being seemingly a focal point of spirits in control of the place, or their final line of defenses, as suggested by the quote:

`Do not hold back` / `WE WILL NOT HOLD BACK`

This positioning proves itself, as there is a distinct passage revealed behind the battlepod, as it was not inended to be placed there by vessel's design.

The quote itself differs from the most, as it is the single instance of the haunted machine referencing itself as "WE", the other one is:

`They will kill us they will kill you` / `THEY WILL KILL US THEY WILL KILL YOU`

Here, as by missions name, inspiration must be sought in the 1993 film of the same name. The synopsis is that the soul of a serial killer is transferred to digital space of a computer network and electrical grid due to faulted MRI scan during electrical storm, which allowed him to continues his killings from the electrical grid and computer network. In the end, he was defeated through an introduction of a computer virus, which trapped him within a network segment and then through application of extreme magnetic field, killed him.

We can attempt to draw parallels with the events on Cradle in regards to the vessel.

The entrapment part may be implied by the presence of gremlin constructs. And to go not so far ahead of the timeline, this is one of a few instances of gremlins building their own containments against the shadow-related entities.

This would also suggest that an unidentified event had caused this notion of haunting. From many phenomenon related to undeath, energy of the Core may be seen as life-animating, could serve as a source which had caused the spirits to haunt the machines under currently unknown condition, potentially, through access to Underworld -- a phenomenon similar in concept to one observed during [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay): `Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power. Spiral HQ requests that you gather together a crack squad of knights and return to the collapsing ruins of Firestorm Citadel in order to discover the source of the disturbance`, -- wherein activity of **the Core, its energy, was the source of curse's reanimation** _without Lord Vanaduke_ to serve as an `eternal will` for the citadel: `You can feel it in the smoldering air - an eternal will holding this place together, never allowing its inhabitants to rest. No creature deserves such a fate, it is beyond my understanding` ([Recon Module: Firestorm Citadel - Grantz](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

With this we propose that both a recount of spirits to material realm and animation of perished entities are the result of Core's energy-related effect. We can interpret the act of returning to metrial realm as soul's intent to live on, while the Core had offered a possibility of such transition, or, the souls is forbidden to move on. As Lord Vanaduke's initial analysis suggested that his will does not allow souls to move on, we have to consider such scenario at a planetary scale.

While we do not possess an accurate explanation, the fact of Core's activity influenceing the curse at Firestorm Citadel, as fall of kingdom of Almire _may have happened_ prior to creation of the Core, leads us to carefully propose that _nature of undeath is universal_ while __energy of the Core amplifies__ those metaphysical processes by __thinnening the boundary between states of death and undeath__, and, as a result, allowing not only souls to traverse across the realms with no issue, but entire regions, as the cases of Almirian Graveyards and Owlite Academy being pulled to Underworld through high concentration of souls or curse.

The case of Firestom Citadel may be seen here as an exception, which may be explained by the same logic of _Lord Vanaduke's will forcibly holding the Citadel in the material realm_, rather than allowing it to fall to Underworld, as was the case of Almirian Necropolis being a graveyard.

Such interpretation grants depth to Lord Vanaduke's character as a determinator, but this is a different topic, which involved a deeper analysis of Kingdom of Almire in general, yet comments on the conclusive nature of Lord Vanaduke's character.

#### Ghost in the Machine: Duality of Souls' intent

Considering it, the battlepod may be seen as a _security measure installed by gremlins_.

In relation to gremlins, due to lack of any candidates, "they" are the ones referred to as "they" by the machine, rather than "WE" (`Do not hold back` / `WE WILL NOT HOLD BACK`):

`THEY WILL KILL US THEY WILL KILL YOU.`

As it was established by the lowercase ghost's quotes, their "they" is _the machine itself_. The machine referring to somebody else, _other then themselves_, should point to a _presence of a third party_. Based on a conclusion that the battlepod and constructs of the cargo bay may belong to gremlins, we propose that machine's **"THEY" refers to gremlins**.

laternatively, the other explanation may be derived from the initial motive of the second voice:

- `Help us` / `SITUATION RESOLVED. PLEASE EXIT THE FACILITY`
- `They are waiting to ambush you ahead` / `MEDICAL SUPPLIES AVAILABLE HERE`

In that interpretaion the "THEY" of the machine may refer to a differnt nonexistent enity in attempt to mislead the knight. While this scenario is plausible, presence of gremlin technology would allow them to be the perpetrators behind containment of the vessel in the docks.

#### Battlepods and Laser Technology

Then there are lasers of Big Iron battlepod.

Their amount indicates presence of the _similar to Roarmulus Twins' technology, Seerus's technology_ which in the prior case is the technology of laser cannons, most clearly seen at the end of [Warfare Workshop of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/Warfare_Workshop). The same cannons are installed into the Roarmulus Twins. But in case of the battlepod, their place takes circular set of artilleries hidden within battlepod's armor.

If the idea of this battlepod being manufactured by gremlins is true, this would mean that [Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory) itself is _also_ **more that a hundred years old**.

Considering its dilapidated state, suggested both by internal design and naming such as its [Abandoned Assembly](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/Abandoned_Assembly), it is highly possible due to a sequence of event which had led to its deteriorated state. In that notion, the state of gremlin clans is also not seen as particularly stable, even if gremlin folklore origins and in-Universe nature are taken in consideration:

- King Tinkinzar is absent: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).
- [Instability](#gremlin-military-industrial-complex) within the Crimson Order and extreme and recent power shift.
- Emberlight still remains and is home for outcasts of the Great Colony: `Emberlight founded by Gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).
- Cradle's defenses are not potentially controlled by gremlins directly, as implied by the quote: `Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)), but as Skylark was shot down, we will return to the nature of those defenses in the [analysis of gremlins](#gremlin-empire).

Now, as for the **identity of the ship, we propose it belongs to Isorans**. Then it can be attributed to either Morai or Isorans within an aforementioned thought framework of Morai being an Isoran colony.

We could develop this thoughfurther and propose that the vessel belongs to Morai, mainly due to the assumption that Spiral Order would have known of its interstellar vessel disappearing or at least be capable of identifying it though prominence of the _Spiral Order insignia of a Spiral Warden_, which the vessel lacks. Spiral Order emblem is not present across Iron Hulk including its bridge. On the other hand, there are cases of Raiders and kingdom of Almire _not recognized as bearing or invoking any similarity to Isorans_ from their perspective.

Yet, in both cases _such scenario_ **introduces a concept of Isoran civilization reaching Cradle in the past -- before Skylark**.

### _Chapter `VI` &#160;<br>_ Undercorp

Tortomega, the [titans](#chapter-titans), descendants of tortoises and far descendants of dragons, exist in their ancestral home -- a [veiled homeland](#ancient-titans), encompassing:

- Gloaming Wildwoods
- [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove)
- [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles)
- [Jigsaw Valley](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jigsaw_Valley)
- [Wolver Dens](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver_Den)
- [Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle)

Those areas, composing now fractured veiled homeland, are identified by tortomega strata of architecture, discussed in the [analysis of titans](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland).

As tortodrones are _the most physically present_ lead to understanding Tortomega, and the least hypothetical, we will start this analysis from what was found during the long migration of tortodrones, specifically, in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove). Through this analysis, given name of this chapter we intend to transition into in-depth analysis of Underworld and Undercorp.

The connection between fiends of Undercorp and tortodrones is posed instantly, as to encounter working tortodrones, albeit in a corrupted state, Spiral Order need to collect [fiendish glyphs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card#Recipe) and transmute a [fiendish identification card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card) in order to gain access to the depths of Ancient Grove, wherein tortodrones are located, at the [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi).

We take note of the name itself -- colossi, -- as a term most likely referring to tortodrones themselves and a "call," while keeping in mind the animal motif and [motif of resiliency](#omega-shell-and-tortomega-motif-of-resiliency) of tortodrones, in particular, the migration cycle of giant tortoises.

#### Ritual Circles, Circle of Art, Pentacles

We will start from a _white ritual circle around inactive tortodrone_ near the exit elevator of [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi).

This circle has same _fiendish sigils_, used across Clockworks in locations _containing mineral pillars_ -- this configuration introduces a pattern of ritual circles being composed of minerals, _other than dark mater_.

Circle of the same color, -- pale white, -- but significantly smaller and lacking fiendish sigils could be found before the Call of The Colossi arena _surrounding an inactive tortodrone part_.

Based on the notion of fiends having in possession working, but modified tortodrones, earlier referred as corrupted, we can suggest that those circles of different color -- currently unknown mineral, -- through encircling of non-corrupt tortodrone parts allow us for vague identification of their functional purpose.

##### Warding Circles

There are instances of dark matter circles, which establish that the observed _location is under devilite control_. Then there are rooms across Clockwork tunnels, which contain mineral pillars placed within mineral circles of the same design as ones found across Daark Cities. The purpose of this pattern of placement of objects within the circes, herein being mineral pillars, we propose, is identical to one of encircled tortodrone parts -- a __metaphysical warding quality__ _of those ritual circles_.

Yet, the pale circles found in Call of the Colossi are made of a different mineral, which, we may suggest, implies a _different party responsible for their creation_ in conjunction with the fact of tortodrone parts within, as within this base system of relataions, _there is no distinct reason for devilites specifically to establish those warding sites_.

This warding property emerges from a _contrast_ between distinctly repurposed tortodone appearances with dark matter and one unmodified through affiliation with Undercorp as a primary suspect for this change.

##### Quality of Tortodrone Corruption

We will revisit this hypothesis of the warding quality as we analyze the imagery of devilite ritual circles outside of this context of tortodrones specifically.

The identification of fought tortodrones as ones being corrupted stems from the differences in the design, compared both to regular tortodrones found marching in the end of Call of the Colossi, and an **enraged tortodrone depicted at mission's card**. The "corruption" or tampering is visible mainly by presence of:

- _purple color_ within _cracked surfaces_, most likely of dark matter
- _stitched shells_, dark matter potruding from top of tortodrones' shells
- _carved sigils on shell's plates in place of eyes_, wherein the eyes are observed on red enraged tortodrone and transmuted 5-star gear

##### Other Instances of Ritual Circles

This leads us back to the importance of dark matter mineral to devilites. Fiendish ritual circles are purple, same as dark matter mineral, the circles found in the Call of the Colossi are ghostly white.

This practice of using different color is observed in other locations:

- At the [Everfrost Tower](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost_Tower) across Amu Sol, and more distincly around the Everprost Pillar, encircling prize boxes
- In a [Margrel ritual circle in the Moorcroft Manor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Konjuring_Kat-Overworld.png)
- [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum), wherein a valestone-like circle surrounds a tome stand with Almirian Codex
- Gold circles at the [Departure of Shroud of Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SotA-Gameplay_End.png)
- [Gold](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Level_Shroud_of_the_Apocrea_puzzle_tower_gold.png) and [Purple floating circles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Devilite_Apocrea_Ritual.png) across [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau)
- Antechamber of [Charred Court of Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court), wherein spirit wells are located, has a _warding and purifying_ quality of dispelling fire from Knight and lifting the curse from Nature Sprites is identified by circles of valestone

Due to consistency of dark matter color, we can conclude that dark matter is not used in those instances, as they are not distinctly purple.

Currently we won't consider different physics of the ritual circles depending on their mineral, but, it is important to note that _there exists an aspect of minerals capable of being charged, which results, as we will soon see, in their color shifting_.

And most importantly, if those circles operate under the same metaphysical laws, this would unite all currently established minerals, potentially with expception of Whitespace Gold Keys, under a single system.

##### Solomon Seals and Pentacles

The ritual circles themselves, including ritual circles, seem to be inspired in their  composition or a layout by the **Solomon seals or the pentacles** of `The Key of Solomon the King`, and, could be pinpointed to a few distinct pentacles, as suggested by [Kentngo on Spiral Knights forums](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/7857#comment-40758): `The Fifth Pentacle of Saturn combined with the meaning of the Seventh Pentacle of the Sun. Two circles, denoting the angels names between the two. The center shows a resemblance to the Third Pentacle of Mercury. Although the angelic names are gibberish in this case`.

<BookCitation source="The Key of Solomon the King">

  The Fifth Pentacle of Saturn. This Pentacle defendeth those who invoke the Spirits of Saturn during the night and chaseth away the Spirits which guard treasures (p.60, fig.15).

  ...

  The Seventh and Last Pentacle of the Sun. If any be by chance imprisoned or detained in fetters of iron, at the presence of this Pentacle, which should be engraved in Gold on the day and hour of the Sun, he will be immediately delivered and set at liberty (p.66, fig.38).

  ...

  The Third Pentacle of Mercury. This and the following serve to invoke the Spirits subject unto Mercury and especially those who are written in this Pentacle (p.68, fig.46).

</BookCitation>

The Pentacles of `The Key of Solomon the King`'s reality become tools, through which operation or interfacing with specific entities or forces, tied to _planets as symbols for concepts_, may be performed by an operator.

And, in case of develiutes' application of those symbols through out-of-universe inspiration, we may further affirm the significance of warding quality of those pentacles.

The idea of protection for dark matter circles, if it functionally identical to other instances of ritual circles, follows along the previous concept of pale white circles as warding ones. The protected target is the one encircled:

- In case of devilites or gremlins those are mineral pillars
- For tortomega narrative, tortodrones themselves

Then, through this logic, the pale circles become affiliated with a different party, as they had used a different mineral for those circles.

We suggest that while the protection aspect persists the other, including non-dark matter, instances of ritual circles demonstrate other abilities of the circles, namely -- a __capacity to summon__. We will cover this property in detail. Yet, we have to consider a following narrative:

- As those circles may possess a universal warding quality, they emerge across different time periods or eras, even, -- such as Owlites, Almire, or modern-day devilites, and even areas, affiliated with Apocrean Realm, -- does this mean that _those circles are not drawn by fiends, but civilizations which had drawn them_ __possess a shared knowledge__?
- And, if devilites are most consistent faction, which uses powers of those pentacles, making the pentacles to be associated with deveilites, does this mean that a __practice itself had to emerge from Underworld culture__?

##### Circle Of Art

While the pantacles exist as the concept and a distinct tool, a colloqual ritual circle itself with its _warding or protecting function_ among other functions is introduced in `The Key of Solomon the King` as the `Circle of Art`:

<BookCitation source="The Key of King Solomon the King">

  Verily, since no experiments for converse with Spirits can be done without shouldest wish to prepared, whatsoever experiments therefore thou wishest to undertake for conversing with Spirits, therein thou must learn to construct a certain particular Circle that being done surround that Circle with a Circle of Art for better caution and efficacy (Book 1, ch. II, "Of the Days, and Hours, and of the Virtues of the Planets").

  ...

  The which being finished, and the fumigations being performed, as is described in the chapter on Fumigations in the Second Book, the Master should reassemble his Disciples, encourage them, reassure them, fortify them, and conduct them into the parts of the Circle of Art, where he must place them in the four quarters of the earth, encourage them, and exhort them to fear nothing, and to keep in the places assigned to them (Book 1, ch. III, "The Construction of the Circle").

  ...

  The Medals or Pentacles, which we make for the purpose ot striking terror into the Spirits and reducing them to obedience, have besides this wonderful and excellent virtue. If thou invokest the Spirits by virtue of these Pentacles, they will obey thee without repugnance, and having considered them they will be struck with astonishment, and will fear them, and thou shalt see them so surprised by fear and terror, that none of them will be sufficiently bold to wish to oppose thy will (Book 1, ch. XVIII, "Concerning the Holy Pentacles or Medals.").

  ...

  Here followeth the Form of the Circle (see Figure 81), wherein whosoever entereth he shall be at safety as within a fortified Castle, and nothing shall be able to harm him (Book 2, sh. IX, "Of the Formation of the Circle").

</BookCitation>

Through this ditinction, the __pentacle-like appearance and role of devilite ritual circles attains scale of the circles of art__, _merging the two distinct concepts into one_, -- a notion we might think of as a generally applicable in fantasy genre of fiction as a whole.

##### Sigil Of a Cross

In that context of merging meanings, we propose, due to those similarities and general themes found in the Key, fiendish symbols in the ritual circles are derived from _Hebrew alphabet_, possessing significance in `The Key of Solomon the King`.

Fiends had carved one nowhere else seen sigil on corrupted tortodrones' back of the shell along with other commonly seen sigils, depicted as a __circled cross__.

With the context of devilite sigils being reminiscent of Hebrew alphabet, we can attempt to categorize this sigil. This description is closely similar to _pictograph of letter Teth "𐤈" of Phoenician alphabet_ or of _Middle Semitic script_, and eventually evolving into the _letter Teth "ט" of early and modern Hebrew alphabet_, used in `The Key of Solomon the King`. In the Key, Early Hebrew alphabet was at the foundation of the _Alphabet of Magic, used by the Key_, with an addition of several other systems, notably, _Malachim alphabet_.

Then, from Hebrew alphabet, letter "teth" became letter _Theta "Θ"_ of _Greek alphabet_. Malachim alphabet will be relevant in the context of the Underworld designs, discussed in regards to the [Nefarious Imp](#nefarious-imp-arctic-plot).

Letter theta in particular has resemblence of the symbol of energy, which we [linked](#technology-alchemy-and-Isoran-redesigns) with the _alchemical symbol of Salt -- "🜔"_. We can suggest that the greek alphabet may be significant to the symbolism of energy, and yet, the connection to concepts attributed to the inverted symbol of energy might coincidentally iffirm the alchimical interpretation, rather than Greek mythology.

The reminiscence of letter theta of the symbol of energy might sign existence of several inspirations, not directly being true but coincidental as much as the above logic of the symbol's origin through language was built.

Yet, considering presented by Underworld cultural and occult motifs in the context of other sigilas and ritual circles, could this cultural or alchemical relation and invocation of older texts be extrapolated onto the relation between Underworld and civilizations of material realm, which possess symbol of energy and _knowledge of ritual circles, derived from a single "ancient" or occult civilization of devilites_?

Those notions does not explain the existence of the circular symbol on tortodrones' back, which makes us think of more direct interpretation of the symbolic meaning of the unique sigil representing theme of tortodrones and their creators, as affiliated with forest and nature.

At that, if we were to selectively find the exact meaning of the symbol in an abstract context, we would find one interpretation, which states that the symbolic meaning of pictograph of letter teth across Semitic script and Old Hebrew alphabet is connected to a depiction of a _pot or a wheel, and of a connection to earth and nature_.

Despite a semi-fitting meaning, it does not reveal more information on tortodrones nor their relation to devilites, but the nature of that information -- as derived of a niche subject of differences and evolution between scripts, -- had to be seen here as coincidental most likely.

#### Summoning from Underworld

Earlier in the analysis of the design and implied nature of devilite ritual circles we have noted on the capacity of ritual circes to summonning.

Apart from warding, protective and potentially controlling properties, which help in establishing general themes of devilites and underworld, ritual circles can summon entities from locations beyond material realm.

There are 2 instances of such application of ritual circles is seen across Clockworks:

- Summoning of Margrel at Moorcroft Manor
- Summoning of the Legion of Ur

##### Summoning of Trojans

The latter is our primary point of analysis for now, as devilites are most evidently involved into the process, while Margrel and Black Kats exist relatively separate from rank missions.

During the events of [return of the Legion of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur), devilites have utilized ritual circles to summon banished to the Underworld trojans: `devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors. Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion or Ur' ... the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back` ([The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)).

Here the alternative approach -- `the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back`, -- devilites had spoken of, is _implied to be used during mission's events_, that of ritual circles.

Then this must mean that an "original" approach should also exist. Notably, from the same memo it is likely that whatever original approach was, _it does not apply for sealed in Underworld entities_.

We propose that the __original approach exists and can be identified -- the technology of grim gates__ found in Ancient Grove and below.

Considering that devilites use the ritual circle method on Cradle, and are considered stranded (`data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us` - [Weight of Darkness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness)), then there should be a reason why they did not use the gates, as it is the only other technology directly related to devilites.

The underlying grim gates technology, paired with relation to tortodrones is one of, if not the first, instances of Underworld, and more specifically, _Undercorp_ presenting itself to material realm in _magnitudes more organized scale_, compared to the event of [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice) or [The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur).

For trojans, the solution was to utilize known sigils and draw ritual circles, pulling trojans from Underworld.

The act of summoning is not observed in-game, compared to summoning of Margrel, but, this act is most likely as implied by _depths' names and internal design_:

- Depth of [Plazamonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Plazamonium) is referred in the [mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur) as the `Summoning Circle` ([The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)).
- In that context `Dimensional Shift` ([The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)) may be identified as an area of dark cities surrounding the ritual site, and it is affected by a shift of dimensions, most likely Underworld and Material Relam in the similar manner as Graveyard-like locations exist between those realms.
- A specific [scenario room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_1.png) has a particularly large ritual site composed of 6 smaller ritual circles, creating and vague outline of a pentacle.

  The information module near the site states: `5 Ways to Appease your Pit Boss` ([Scenario Room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scenario_room)), this might reveal more about internal corporate structure of Undercorp -- that of __unfamiliar utilized as mundane__, -- the _urban, corporate setting of devilites' dark cities is combined with the theme of mundane occult_.

##### Summoning of Margrel at Moorcroft Manor

In the Moorcroft Manor, black kat Margrel of the Kat Tribe is summoned through the process of applying incantation from the [Book of Dark Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals) to the [ritual circle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Konjuring_Kat-Overworld.png).

Margrel summoning is characterized by a formation of a dark-pink maelstrom enveloping the space below the manor. The maelstrom itself is practically identical to one later observed across the grim gates of Call of The Colossi, once [their open portal is destroyed at the end of devilite onslaught, with a blue-purple core](#grim-gtes-portal-collapse). That same pattern of activation and deactivation is found across event-tied fiend danger rooms across Clockwork tunnels.

##### Summoning of Devilites

We will look into grim gates, as technology, soon enough. But, as of currently, we must make a few initial conclusions based on aforementioned topics on the operation and visible function of ritual circles:

- Ritual circles are identified as alchemical Circles of Art, and possess a capacity to be used in means of _summoning from Underworld_ and in means of _spiritual, metaphysical protection_ of an encircled object.
- Through ritual circles entities _can be brought in_ from Underworld, surpassing their sealed state within Underworld, such being trojans of Legion of Ur.
- Grim gates possess a link to ritual circles as seemingly more refined and scalable solution, but without ability to summon "sealed" entities and require a distinctly identified power source from transmuted fiendish glyphs.
- Grim gates can link not only material realm and Underworld, but also _different points of material realm_, as seen in the transition between grim gates of Ancient Grove and Call of The Colossi.

In both cases we are presented with a scenario of Underworld reaching material realm through means, which utilize metaphysics of that Universe. And, due to existence of this notion across multiple missions, we should suggest a motivation behind those acts -- _why Underworld or Undercorp had to reach material relam, and, potentially, Cradle specifically_?

Whether the case may be, grim gates and ritual circles are an established technology used for those means, then, there must be a point, when Underworld reached material realm for the first time.

Given established roster of locations and narratives, which directly involve devilites, we propose that tortomega are one of the earliest civilizations which had to encounter devilites, with exclusion of Valkyries, but, as their conflict was not shown directly, we have less direct or confirmed information regarding their relation.

At that, tortomega present an important perspective on Underworld, as Underworld or Undercorp had used tortodrones -- whom we can study in attempt to understand the means and ends of their repurposed role.


<!--Considering that the dragons were a unique species in our thought framework, discovery of Underworld through their means, - through relation to dragons and inheritance of their abilities, - in case of tortomega, of potentially rage or frenzy. The latter could be the case, if we take [fiendish statues'](#fiendish-statues) depiction of tortomega as-is, rather than an interpretation, due to their design reminiscent of devilites.-->

<!--If titans did uncover Underworld, likely a more rudimentary approach of _ritual circles_ was used, but so far, apart from white warding circles, there are no evidence of such action. The mention of a war with valkyries in the beginning in this context could be interpreted as a precedent for titans' research, or, Underworld would itself make appearance without major actions from titans.-->

#### Undercorp's Initial Advancements

The cultural aspect of Underworld's influence onto material realm and tortomega is found in the motif of eyes. Specfifcally for tortodrones, it is found on tortodrone shells -- the shape of the eye is universal across its many instances, which we have erlier called the evil eye for reference. The argument stems from an idea that tortomega _would not have other methods of attaining the recognizable symbol of an eye by other means, other than contact with the Underworld_.

Following this idea, we have to study the nature of [Snarbolax](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse) and [miasma](#miasma) of Gloaming Wildwoods, as both relate in their respective ways to undeath and nature of shadow damage. The miasma exists largely on its own, and will be covered in the [analysis of Shadow Lairs](#analysis-of-shadow-lairs).

With Underworld uncovered in the past, devilites and Undercorp arrived with [Greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver). Greavers will be important at explaining further presence of the eye symbolism in relation to curse at the [evil eye section](#evil-eye).

There are a few technologies, other than grim gates, which charaterize Undercorp in different ways.

When Undercorp was present in the material relam earlier in the timeline, around exsitence of tortomega, several technologies were either developed or introduced to material realm:

- Invention of [Graviton Bomb and Graviton Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb). Whether tortomega were potentially aware of power of frenzy or shadow, we think that the bomb was created after the arrival of devilites as it has an **ornament evil eye** present on it, uncharacteristic of _more simple design of the evil eye_ present of Greavers' helm. Bomb's design of the shell and its explosion's sigil has the same _ornament evil eye depicted_.
- Being similar to graviton bomb it its design [Vortex Block](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Vortex_Block.png) uses the same gravity-related principles. It contains a dark pulsating core, as it is present in those arenas. The presence of explosive blocks as a distinct technology is also important, which we will [cover separately]().
- Material, [Vile seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vile_Seal) is utilized in alchemy of bombs and many shadow-related equipment. The seal itself is explicitly related by drop rate and description, to occult themes of Underworld: `A small scrap of ancient parchment imbued with dark magicks. It is believed that they grant power to those with evil souls` ([Vile seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vile_Seal)). It hints at a metaphysical trasnfer of power.

Whether grim gates were invented during this period of time is unknown, as they have strictly devilite imagery, compared to the rest of technology. As for the naming convention, there are also [grim totems](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Totem#Grim_Totem), which __revive zombies from their skulls__ -- _a concept seemingly related to_ [souls inhabiting the skulls](#lost-souls-with-skulls). Considering it, there are a few other items relating to death or Underworld in some ways though the naming convention of "grim":

- `Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of Death itself` ([Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask)).
- [Grim Scarabs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Scarab#Grim_Scarab) which have relation to undeath and spirits during the [Dark Harvest Festival](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Harvest_Festival): `This annual event honors the mischievous Punkin King in order to ensure a healthy fall harvest for Haven` ([
Patch Notes - October 17, 2012 - The Dark Harvest Festival](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/66484)).
- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of darkness and decay` ([Grim Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens))
- Although not related directly, [Grim Repeater](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Repeater), as it is a shadow damage weapon with a characteristic description: `Used only by the most elite of the Spiral Knight rangers, this devilish machine gun earned its name from the incredible speed in which it hands out shadowy tickets to the afterlife` ([Grim Repeater](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Repeater)).

Based on a few such instances, it is most likely that Grim Totems and Grim Gates are of Undercorp development or Underworld in general, contrasting each other in technology, wherein ritual circles and grim totems may be grouped together. At that, _grim totams_, as they possess a capacity to revive, are most distinctly a _technology from Underworld_.

#### Grim Gates: An Introduction

Finally, the [Grim Gates](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Call_of_the_Colossi) were introduced to the material realm if not constructed in place, -- as means of large-scale transportation between Underworld and material realm with the base of operation at [Call of The Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi), Ancient Grove.

Call of The Colossi __depth is referred as the "staging area"__ in [Morgral'm's memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove): `An ID Card is required to access the staging area. Properly presenting the ID Card will consume it to power the Grim Gate`, highly suggesting that this area had its own dedicated role for Undercorp's operations in material realm.

The term `staging area` is usually used in relation to logistics, construction, aviation and military, -- _a point of arrival, departure, or transit_, **wherein preparations are made**.

The depth itself is locked behind [Fiendish ID Card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card) and has large amount of gates, aligning with the characteristic of a staging area. The area is connected to, potentially, the Underworld, as seen by the **dark city interior with an opened portals in the gates**, _with an inactive tortodrone in sight_.

Grim Gates are powered by the glyphs, as those are used to create the [card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card) and carried by fiends -- `An ID Card is required to access the staging area. Properly presenting the ID Card will consume it to power the Grim Gate` ([March of the Tortodrones - Ancient Grove - Morgral'm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m)), sharing more information on the underlying principles of portals' physics.

#### Fiendish Glyphs

Naming convention of glyphs with their appearance may shed some light on the inspirations and principles behind Underworld and devilites in general through recognition of a common motifs and themes.

There are 5 fiendish glyphs in total required to construct a fiendish identification card, which also functions as power source for the gates: `An ID Card is required to access the staging area. Properly presenting the ID Card will consume it to power the Grim Gate. Remember: "When you Use it, you Lose it"` ([March of Tortodrones - Ancient Grove - Fiendish Memo: Morgral'm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove)). This fact alone suggests that _those glyphs have an internal power capacity, similar to minerals_, as they will be [discussed later](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).

##### Metaphysical Essences

Glyphs' icons in the inventory also provide more context on their nature. Here we apply a similar concept as for the missions' description -- that the inventory interface icons intend to further characterize an depict their materials and _are designed under Spiral Order classification of materials_.

In the inventory fiendish glyphs _are depicted as essences_, yet being identified as glyphs -- characters in a writing system. Through this common attribute of a selected inventory icon depicting certain materials, we can establish a motif based on other instances of this inventory icon being used:

- `A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage` ([Flame Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul)).
- `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps` ([Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser)). While it differs thematically from the rest, we must keep in mind that its original name of the material was `Spark of Life` (`The old ‘Spark of Life’ crafting material has been renamed to 'Storm Chaser'` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)). While this context is relatively important, as it allow to trace a history of changes and out-of-iniverse vision, we will rely on the current naming convention further on.
- `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease` ([Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence)).
- `A small patch of ice crystals that never seem to melt, even when exposed to direct heat` ([Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost)).
- `A mote of burning energy salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time` ([Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)).

Those instances suggest that it in not the representation of a burning fire, rather than one including it into a greater concept, which extends into properties of materials, not usually found in material realm -- __becoming metaphysical essences__. In this regard, the very name of essences will be used further on due to its ambigious nature, while being mentioned in relation to [Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence) as one of multiple examples of the material category.

##### Glyph Names and Metaphysics of Color

The glyphs possess color, and due to relevancy of minerals, their hidden nature and universal nature shared across different civilizations, from devilites to gremlins by their application, we can attempt to link minerals to glyphs from a perspective, which interprets this _coincidence as emergent from a symbolic system_:

- Name [Amu Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Amu_Glyph), color pink, relation to crimsonite: `said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it`.
- Name [Nok Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Nok_Glyph), color green, relation to valestone: `said to contain the essence of all natural life`.
- Name [Sol Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Sol_Glyph), color yellow, relation luminite: `said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it`.
- Name [Tor Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Tor_Glyph), color blue, relation to moonstone: `said to contain the knowledge and origins of all worlds`.
- Name [Ur Glyph](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Ur_Glyph), color purple, relation to dark matter: `said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`.

This concept of color relation, apart from glyphs' color, is also found in the texts of `The Key of Solomon the King`, which might connect mineral colors to ones described in the Key through alchemical interpretation and symbolism:

<BookCitation source="The Key of King Solomon the King">

  These Pentacles are usually made of the metal the most suitable to the nature of the Planet; and then there is no occasion to observe the rule of particular colours. They should be engraved with the instrument of Art in the days and hours proper to the Planet.

  Saturn ruleth over Lead; Jupiter over Tin; Mars over Iron; the Sun over Gold; Venus over Copper Mercury over the mixture of Metals; and the Moon over Silver.

  They may also be made with exorcised Virgin paper, writing thereon with the colours adopted for each Planet, referring to the rules already laid down in the proper Chapters, and according to the Planet with which the Pentacle is in sympathy.

  Wherefore unto Saturn the colour of Black is appropriated Jupiter Mars over Red the Sun over Gold, or the colour ruleth over Celestial Blue of Yellow or Citron; Venus over Green; Mercury over Mixed Colours; the Moon over Silver, or the colour of Argentine Earth (Book 1, ch. XVIII, "Concerning the Holy Pentacles or Medals").

  ...

  THE ORDER OF THE PENTACLES.

  (1.) Seven Pentacles consecrated to Saturn=Black.

  (2.) Seven Pentacles consecrated to Jupiter=Blue.

  (3.) Seven Pentacles consecrated to Mars=Red.

  (4.) Seven Pentacles consecrated to the Sun=Yellow.

  (5.) Five Pentacles consecrated to Venus=Green.

  (6.) Five Pentacles consecrated to Mercury=Mixed Colours.

  (7.) Six Pentacles consecrated to the Moon=Silver.

  (Book 1, ch. XVIII, "Concerning the Holy Pentacles or Medals").

</BookCitation>

The importance of planet and the earlier relation or associations of spirits to those planets stems from their celestially divine nature as heavens:

<BookCitation source="The Key of King Solomon the King">

  There are different kinds of Spirits, according to the things over which they preside, some of them govern the Empyrean Heaven, others the Primum Mobile, others the First and Second Crystalline, others the Starry Heaven; there are also Spirits of the Heaven of Saturn, which I call Saturnites there are Jovial, Martial, Solar, Venerean, Mercurial, and Lunar Spirits there are also (Spirits) in the Elements as well as in the Heavens, there are some in the Fiery Region, others in the Air, others in the Water, and others upon the Earth, which can all render service to that man who shall have the good fortune to understand their nature, and to know how to attract them. (Introduction)

</BookCitation>

While this is not a direct mapping, we suggest it is a pattern, emerging in many different mediums, as those derive their identity from elements rooted in reality. Using this framework as an _approximate thematic guide_ given vague and often contradictiory nature of alchemy and occult texts, we may identify those _similarities as evidence of preexistig symbolic systems_.

The names of glyphs are also found in [fiendish cities](#dark-cities) of `Amu-Sol` and `Sol' Fork`, and fiendish legion of Ur consisting of trojans. The application of names across dark cities may suggest that glyphs may hold multiple meanings to them, not as letters, but words or concepts, which reflect glyphs' specific purpose, given their variety of color and properties of natural lnanguage.

##### Name of Ur

Then there is legion of Ur. The presence of Ur name in legion's name, if taken from real world history, implies Ur being legion's commander, a single entity. Other clue stems from the history of the Roman Empire. Their legions' names had a nomenclature: numerical, which is not relevant here, and titled. The latter case seems applicable to this legion. In that context, Ur may be a figurehead's name. As names may mean concepts of qualities, the attribution of a quality as a title to a legion within language of Underworld is also plausible.

Here we suggest a following interpretation. If the inspirations of `The Key of Solomon the King` are taken into account, with addition of pup-cultural meaning, then glyphs, as written characters, have power to spell entities' names, names of devilites and deities, as colloqual understanding of those mechanics similar to a merge of a Circle of Art and pentacles. This may not conflict with the mentioned concept of glyphs, as glyphs reveal only part of that system, while there are other namg conventions, such as names like `Morgral'm`. _As Ur may symbolise a concept or quality, it may also be a name of a person_.

And then, as _this is a narrative_, both the person with this name may reflect those qualities within occult system of themes and history of Underworld, as well as the __meaning of the name, name of the legion, can reflect the history of the legion__.

##### Glyph Technology: Data and Energy Storage

Then there is application of glyphs in the semi-technological context. In the [Golden Slime Casino there are a few Pit Bosses](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino), which state:

- `Productivity is up two percent since I started mandatory overtime.`
- `I promoted myself to Senior Manager of Ghastly Implements of Destruction.`
- `I worked my employees hard to get where I am today.`
- `I just put in another bulk order for office supplies. We keep running out.`
- `The guy in Devil-IT wanted to upgrade our office to all glyph-usage, but I like wasting paper when I can.`

Among those lines, w of them seem particularly important, whish suggest existence of a different department of Undercorp alongside _Resource Allocations_ and _Eternal Torment Division_: _Ghastly Implements of Destruction_.

In the context of glyphs it is established that _those can be used across offices as a replacement for paper_: `The guy in Devil-IT wanted to upgrade our office to all glyph-usage, but I like wasting paper when I can` ([Golden Slime Casino - Pit Boss](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino)). This quote does not explicitly reveal the nature of glyphs, but established __their application as data storage medium__, _more efficient than the paper medium_.

With this we have 2 very different purposes, or rather, applications of glyphs -- as an __energy storage__, and a __data storage__, _scalable enough to replace paper across the office_. As devilites are stated (`Spiral HQ suspects that the glyphs that the Fiends carry with them might be the keys to opening the gate yourself` - [March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission))) to carry glyphs with themselves, this suggests that the __glyphs are mass-produced__.

Combined with the depictions of fiendish sigils which may or may not be the same glyphs may potentially reveal a following scenario.

If devilite sigils are glyphs, and the prior are made of dark matter, this may, in the course of the [Minerals and Souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), make _glyphs to be energy carriers as much as minerals contain energy_, which would explain the logic behind __power source of the Grim Gates as relating back to minerals as much as toerodrones are__.

These cases of glyphs' application, close relation to souls and energy, we suggest, may reveal an existence of a __soul or energy-based economy of Underworld__, with souls as an external conduits for energy to native energy mediums of glyphs.

Furthermore, as we have positioned grim gates as technologically more complex to ritual circles and grim totems, so glyphs are grouped with grim gates as instances of more advanced technology within Underworld and percieved as such within Undercorp.

##### Relation to Deities

As there are 5 known glyphs, with at least 2 fiendish cities having names which are partially made of those glyphs' names, could it be that glyphs could also refer to Underworld deities?

We believe this distinction must be brought up. On the other hand, there are deities likely inhabiting Underworld, as stated by [Wicked Idol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol): `One of many statuettes carried by fiends as a means of gaining favor with their dark gods`.

Those deities could include [Hail deity](#influences-of-undeworld), [Vile deity](#fiendish-cults) and [Magma deity](#fiendish-cults). [Magma deity](#fiendish-cults) specifically, we proposed ealier, is Vog, -- by the fact of both exerting fiendish influence and similar themes. We will also propose of those deities being located in the Underworld, [explored later in relation to Lord Vanaduke](#king-in-the-mountain).

Considering naming convention of glyphs but without deeper linguistic analysis, Vog could plausibly fit there as a name for a fiendish glyph. The latter scenario of those entities, such as Ur, being immortal, can be implied by the name of a division, referred by Morgral'm: `As your division's disciplinary action will undoubtedly result in relocation to the Eternal Torment Division, this will likely be our final correspondence. I wish you luck in your continued career here at Undercorp` ([Morgral'm - Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m)). This results in an idea, related to physiology of devilites -- are devilites immortal? While we don't have information regarding it, we can explore other aspects of Underworld enterprises.

#### Undercorp's Graviton Technology

Grim Gates, while of Undercorp development, as seen by the devilite carvings, are based on the same gravity technology by which [graviton bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb) operates.

Yet, the gates have the capacity to transport living beings, as suggested by the function itself. This requires for _2 gates in a pair to be opened to sustain a stable connection_ across material realm or the Underworld. A mechanism can be deduced form the gates' behavior when interacted in the Ancient Grove, as the Call of the Colossi depth starts from the gates' platform.

The lager grim gates of Ancient Grove are used to access the staging area. Those gates are unique in their configuration, as they use tortodrone technology -- tortodrone arms with _beams of red light_, potentially crimsonite being located within. Crimsonite will be further expanded upon. We may suggest that a much larger gates could have been used to transport devilites and potentially entire cities into the material realm, taken presented variation in grim gates' scale.

Another suggestion can be also made here that "armed" grim gates are the initial portal through which a connection is made. When the knight have arrived to the Ancient Grove, the portal was already active but locked, while the other side does not have the characteristic arms as well as gremlin monitors as an interface. Could it be that the portals in Undercorp's possession are constructed in similar manner and linked to portals near the Ancient Grove? Currently, considering all of earlier instances and similarities, this proposal is applicable, as it offer a non-conflicting explanation to the logistics, which pose greater significance _within a corporate setting of Undercorp_.

#### Grim Gate Portal Collapse

When activated, grim gates generate a vortex, the _same one observed in broken vortex blocks and graviton bombs_. After the vortex forms, a portal at its center opens depicting a dark city-like interior with an inactive tortodrone in sight.

But when vortex of Vortex block or Graviton bomb is presented, instead of a portal, a dark sphere of pulsing matter is only visible during their initial activation phase prior to explosion.

If grim gate's portal is broken in its active or opened state, it explodes in a fiery explosion similar to an [explosive block](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Exploration). Apart from those similarities there is one important element of _portal's life cycle_ -- its collapse.

As seen in the [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi), the portals are linked in, at least, pairs. Then, after all present devilites or tortodrones are removed, a particular behavior is seen across _danger rooms_ during tortodrones' Long Migration and at the [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi): _currently opened portals explode in the same graviton-like explosion observed_ in [Vortex Block](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Vortex_Block.png), which over time transforms into much larger, more powerful __maelstrom of fiendish pink hue with a flat dark purple core__. The purple maelstrom, due to its context and violaent apperance compared to the prior state of a vortex may be a result of an open portal on devilite's side being forcibly closed -- or, more generally, __an instance of incorrect operation of the technology__.

By severing the connection, Underworld's nature bleeds into the material realm _identified by the pink hue_. In that physical state of a connection the gates may point to a location of no return, as no established portal, a lack of required technology of stable grim gates would allow for a proper connection, or potentially, a one-directional connection.

This is a plausible interpretation as the same maelstrom phenomenon is observed in one other case -- during summoning of [Margrel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel) through the [Book of Dark Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals) as discussed in the [summoning section](#margrel-and-immortality-through-curse). Only after Mergrel is banished, the maelstrom disappears. More so, given its nature, we would wager that this phenomenon is not an expected behavior.

As the maelstrom had appered from ritual circle, compared to grim gates, it would fit within the system establshed earlier of ritual cirlces being an earlier development, followed by scalable solution of grim gates.

And as trojans were summoned through ritual circles -- pulled from Underworld, so was Mergrel, -- through this logic we earlier proposed the specifics of that connection over grim gates, as building upon the same metaphysics, and falling back on them in case of malfunction or severing of a connection, resulting in the described maelstrom.

If we apply back this idea to other technology, we could offer an explanation to vortex block and graviton bombs -- as __Vortex block and Graviton bomb being weaponized instances of a phenomenon resulting from improper closure of a connection with Underworld__.

In relation to the vortex itself, we note presence of curse associated with dark-pink color scheme and connection to Underworld. And, given more violent nature of collapsed grim gates and Margrel's summoning, we propose existence of a distinct effect on nearby areas of material realm, wherein this even took place -- _accumulation of curse in material realm through the portal_.

#### Snarbolax And <span class="through-curse">Haunting Through Curse</span>

The described [portal collapse](#grim-gates-portal-collapse) releases pink hue into the material realm. We have proposed that this is an essence of Underworld in more abstract terms of speculative fiction, a residue of Underworld being linked to material realm. Now we propose that pink hue is manifestation of curse.

We propose that this usage of the gates, paired with other [weaponized graviton technology](#undercorps-graviton-technology), with the presence of curse had its own effects onto the region. The curse, originating from the grim gates, had settled in nearby wildlife, most evident by the presence of Snarbolax within the Gloaming Wildwoods and later introduction of the [miasma](#miasma).

Snarbolax will serve here the first most distinct case study of __curse afflicting creatures of material realm not by detriment, but empowerment__. Here it is important to analyze nature of Snarbolax in that proposed context.

Gloaming Wildwoods were inhabited by a [Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax). Items made of its fur (`A coat of coarse fur taken from a Snarbolax` [Nightmare Mane](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane)), as well as a few others, have a focus on dangers of sighting Snarbolax. Snarbolax has established _supernatural presence existing beyond its death_ during knights' passthrough of the Gloaming Wildwoods:

- Snarbolax itself has a default state of invincibility with a [shadow color scheme](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Category:Shadow-Themed).

  Dispelled invincibility or stunned state reveals Snarbolax's more [natural fur coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Monster-Snarbolax_stunned.png), similar to [wolvers' 3 color pattern one of which is white accent](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Monster-Alpha_Wolver_3.png). Rabid Snarbolax is poison themed, possibly relating to the [poison-themed cults](#fiendish-cults).

  On the other hand, the [fur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane) acquired from the Shadow Lairs is of color belonging to a shadowed state.

- Equipment made of this fur -- [Snarbolax Cap](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Cap) and [Snarbolax Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Coat) both state: `Even looking at it too closely is dangerous`, although currently this could be a hyperbolized writing, we believe it will gain larger connotation in the context of next few items considered.
- Barbarous [Thorn blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade): `Those who wield it claim to feel the fiery stare of the beast upon them whenever they close their eyes`.

  The charge attack has a ghostly image of Snarbolax performing a bite, similar to ghostly apparitions of wolver in case of [Wild Hunting Blade's charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Hunting_Blade) and a larger wolver with a snarl and wide red eyes reminiscent of [Maulos' Perma-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur). This blade, notably, also has a poison counterpart - [Dread Venom Striker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Venom_Striker).

- Dark [Thorn Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Blade) which is upgraded to [Barbarous Thorn blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade), the prior specifies that it is a `savage sword whose strength has been fortified by an offering of souls to the beast within`. With the beast most certainly referring to the Snarbolax, given its relevancy.
- Twisted [Snarble Barb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Twisted_Snarble_Barb) has color scheme of a _stunned Snarbolax_ with its overall green hue and lime-like color reminiscent of [Rabid Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rabid_Snarbolax) thorns.

  This color scheme may hint at Snarbolax's dispelled of its shadowy nature apperances, when coupled with trophies:

  - `A small Snarbolax statuette, showing the savage shadow in a stunned state` [Replica Natural Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Natural_Snarbolax).
  - `A large model Snarbolax, depicting in minute detail his jaws that bite and claws that catch` [Replica Shadowy Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Shadowy_Snarbolax).

  The natural to shadowy distiction, we suggest, is the key to understanding the natural apperance of Snarbolax prior to any external curse-like influence outside of its anatomy.

- Dark [Briar Barrage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Briar_Barrage) on detonation summons ghostly apparition of Snarbolax, with a matching description: `A mythical object that can explode with the fury of the Snarbolax itself. The unearthly howl it produces is said to be more crippling than its blast`.
- Barbarous [Thorn Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Shield) imitates Snarbolax's three-eye pattern and states the following: `its said the beast can use the glowing orbs on the shield's face to see and stalk weak-hearted wielders`.
- Dark [Thorn Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Shield) plain specifies: `A gloomy guard that gives one's sword strikes a supernatural savagery`.

Based on those items Snarbolax has several supernatural properties. There are no enemies, and especially of beast family on Cradle, which would possess such powers, with the exception of [Perma-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma-Frostifur#Perma-Frostifur).

##### Perma-Frostifurs and Blinding Abyss

Perma-[Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma-Frostifur#Perma-Frostifur) are invincible and are not explicitly delievered by Undercorp, given [Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol), as they are absent in the description of the requested items: `Please provide a detailed summary of your projected use of the following requested resources: - 999 'Open minded' devilites ... - 50 barrels of 'whatever frostifurs eat' ... - A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - 'Fiendish Memo'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol)).

If we attempt to draw parallels of [Underworlds' influence](#influences-of-underworld), we can suggest that as Vog cubs are transformed by a magma deity and so are Perma-Frostifurs are transformed by a Hail deity in the same manner as we see Maulos and Lord Vanaduke.

Placement of the Blinding Abyss in that regard can be explained by an interpretation of Underworld paired with frost themes of Blinding Abyss as partially inspired by a layered structure of Hell in `Dante's Inferno`, wherein the Ninth Circle, compared to the rest, had themes of ice, water, and frost.

Blinding Abyss can relate either to the Underworld itself, as it was referring to an entire structure of `Dante's Inferno` Hell, reaching to the center of the Earth, or, a more ancient archetype found across myths. This idea, we propose, was integrated within the structure of Underworld -- as Underworld is a different realm, the cosmology also is required to cover now metaphysics of not the single realm, but multiple.

As in the Underworld [devilites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite#Types) exist and [greavers of different elemental types](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver#Types), we propose that __Blinding Abyss is located below the Underworld, in the process becoming a different realm of frost, identified by its name__, same as the Abyss of `Dante's Inferno` was reaching bottom of the World.

##### Cursed Fur

Returning to Snarbolax, there is such wording as `supernatural savagery`, `unearthly howl`, and mention of souls in the [Barbarous Thorn blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade). We propose that all of the above characteristics imply relation to Underworld, as it is one of 2 primary actors concerned with souls. Specifically, _Snarbolax became cursed through an influence of Underworld_.

The final and most evident, as we see it, argument towards intrinsic connection between Snarbolax and curse emerges from 2 items when they are analyzed together:

- Snarbolax's fur -- [Nightmare Mane](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane), -- is described as `A coat of coarse fur taken from a Snarbolax. Each fiber seems to curl and fray as if life is still flowing through it`.
- The [Snarbostuffing](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbostuffing) refers to fur as cursed, as does not decay in its presence: `A dense, fluffy stuffing made from a special polymer that doesn't break down when exposed to the cursed fur of the Snarbolax. Its perfect for creating trophies or adorable, cursed, stuffed toys` ([Snarbostuffing](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbostuffing)).

This recontextualizes Nightmare Mane's description -- `seems to curl and fray as if life is still flowing through it` within the idea of _life after death_ by a presence of lingering life. This idea of lingering was also attributed to souls: `The dust of the departed. Whether it still retains any shred of a soul remains to be seen` ([Soul Dust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul_Dust)).

If the curse indeed lingers, how it was achieved? As we intoduced an idea of curse appearing in maerial relam, we offered an explanation of grim gates being the source of this supernatural power, -- the result of their improper usage near the ancient grove, -- as the resulting explosions of the portals, discussed earlier have a characteristic, _associated with the curse, dark-red and pink mist_, present when portal explodes from the other side.

The curse affects only living creatures. Depending on its source, it can be fully detrimental -- as in case of Spiral Knights and Nature Sprites, or come with additions -- as in case of [Lord Vanaduke](#king-in-the-mountain), and at least for Snarbolax's fur, as living after owner's death or _greatly extending their life_.

Considering the absence of tortomega and suggested here and by tortodrone mission description (`Investigations into the cause were inconclusive, but Spiral HQ suspects fiends are somehow involved` - [March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones)), connection with devilites and Undercorp, this scenario of Underworld's influence on material realm wildlife would be particularly plausible, likely being the exact [pink miasma found in the Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods](#miasma).

Apart from this miasma and a potential offering of souls in [Dark Thorn Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Blade): `A savage sword whose strength has been fortified by an offering of souls to the beast within`, -- the method through which Snarbolax became cursed in the first place, is related to the past presence of Titans in the woods as the only sentiant civilization with its own traces across those regions.

Under this assumption, we can also explain general thematic shift of alchemy tree of high-tier Snarbolax gear. Last 2 tiers of equipment, 5 and 4 stars', are themed around shadowy Snarbolax, while 2 and 3 star gear is attributed to natural Snarbolax, prior to explicitly supernatural influence.

At that, we propose that items acquired for [Frumious Fang tokens](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Token#Frumious_Fang) exist within an _alchemy tree representing a transformation from natural to supernatural_. Similar, if not exact themes reflected in Snarbolax trophies:

- `A small Snarbolax statuette, showing the savage shadow in a stunned state` ([Replica Natural Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Natural_Snarbolax)).
- `A large model Snarbolax, depicting in minute detail his jaws that bite and claws that catch` ([Replica Shadowy Snarbolax](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Shadowy_Snarbolax)).

It seems to us that the name of natural and accompanied Snarbolax's design solidifies it as different state of being from the latter - shadowy, in which Snarbolax is invincible.

As a side note, the grouping of [Snarbolax Slippers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Slippers#Snarbolax_Slippers) with the rest of wolver families' slippers in the [cozy prize box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box) may suggest that Snarbolax was at some point in time a wolver, or an adjacent specie. And based on the [Snarblepup](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Snarblepup)) reskin of Maskeriath battle sprite, we can more confidently suggest Snarbolax being a canid, despite its muzzle's shape, as being referred as a pup. On the other hand, this naming scheme is a reflection of [gun puppies being inspired by drakes](#depictions-of-a-stone-dragon-gun-puppy).

#### Tortodrone Equipment

As grim gates possess strictly Undercorp-themed design, they related to tortodrones through the usage of their arms in the [Ancient Grove](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove) [gates](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Grim_Gate.png).

We will start from a few alchemical recipes of tortodrone equipment that had remained and found in the [Mysterious Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mysterious_Alchemy_Machine).

Among them are found such items as combination of tortomega and [Gorgo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo) -- [gorgomega](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgomega). But, Gorgomega's recipe is made of mostly Underworld-related materials in its alchemy, which does relate to gorgos. _Which materials are meant to be associated with tortomega?_ The only material used here and unrelated to Underworld directly is the [ancient shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell).

The shield itself is an upgrade of [Nether Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nether_Shell) which is stated to be `alchemized from the shell of a corrupted tortodrone` ([Nether Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nether_Shell)). Does this mean that corrupted tortodrones were already present in the far past? It may be so, but no evidence of that is explicitly found. Unless, we consider seemingly supernatural properties of _Mysterious Alchemy Machine as one not requiring a recipe to be learned_ -- __the knowledge of that gear is external__ in the same manner as Sanctuary Alchemy Machine offers its gear.

At the same time, elemental shield and its alchemy path like [Omegaward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward) are seem to be constructed much later, as they utilize Owlite and undead-related materials -- [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather) and [ghost bell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Bell) accordingly.

There is also [Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise), it has piercing defense, stating that `even a rampaging wolver pack would have a hard time puncturing its reinforced plates` ([Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise)). The shell itself is said to be hardened: `A shield alchemized from a hardened tortodrone shell` ([Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise)). As the defenses are piercing and the materials there used are [Dragon Scale](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale) and [Critter Carapace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Critter_Carapace), they seem ones giving this defense, relating back to dragons' relation to beast enemy class. Unless somewhere across Cradle roams a hardened shell tortodrone, this period of time, when the shield was invented, remains unknown. Although, considering that Spiral Order had experience of using dragon scales in their own alchemy, and presence of wolvers in the description might suggest that piercing-resistant variant of the shell was devised by the Spiral Order on Cradle, although the source of that gear as lacking a recipe contradicts it.

As for the [Grand Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortoise): `A shield empowered by the limitless fury of a tortodrone. The very plates of this colossal carapace shake as the unstable energy within waits to be unleashed` -- it seems to be the one most significant in overall context of tortodrone-derived technology. It will be kept in mind for the analysis of a relation between tortodrones, crimsonite, and concept of rage. Considering that the starting item of the alchemy tree is the [Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plate_Shield), it might only support the idea of __alchemy superseding time and causality on Cradle__, as a shield similar to the prior is used by gremlin [Mortafires](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mortafire). The [Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core) material, on the other hand, seems anachronistic as the slimes had arrived on Cradle only recently. This material then seems like a substitute, present in the current environment after Skylark's crash landing -- an idea [presented earlier](#utilitarian-alchemy) in terms of _how alchemy operates and how it is used to extract symbolic value of the materials of their ages and associations_ -- as [utilitarian alchemy of Spiral Order](#utilitarian-alchemy).

Within this system special damage type variants of tortodrone gear remain unknwon. While we could not come to a distinct explanation, the specifics of their nature further establsihed the role of symbolic order over causal within current alchemy-based system.

- In case of special damage type tortodrone gear being a recent invenstion, it would characterise Mysterious Alchemy Station furthemore complex, as well as deepen Spiral Order understanding of this technology through magic on Cradle compared to their initial position prior to Cradle, as __inhereting and incorporating both Undercorp and Owlite technology into their own__ -- a notion that was [already established](#application-of-magic) with progressing application of magic by Spiral Order.

  Quotes such as `A shield alchemized from the shell of a corrupted tortodrone` ([](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Shell)) characteize those states as external to tortodrone, while `hardened tortodrone shell` of [Wild Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Shell) and explicitly stated `elemental resiliency` of [Barrier Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barrier_Shell) may be interpreted both as existing in the past as well as only on modern-day Cradle, as ownership of modified states of those shells is left ambigious.

- In case of special damage type gear being attributed to tortomega, this would imply existence of those tortodrones far in the past, expanding on their complexities and complex relation between Undercorp and tortomega. Rediscovery of those variants in the future -- of modern-day Cradle, -- would still allow Spiral Order to symbolically inherit whis technology and further integrate it into theirs, as [it was explored with kingdom of Almire](#isoran-designs-of-almire).

  In that regard even corruted tortodrones may exist in the past to the point of being the primary Undercorp-controlled force during tortomega extinction. Such interpretation would allow to attribute both elemntal and hardened tortodrones shells as existing in the past, but, in game's scope remaining unexplored exlicitly in the same manner as existence of [multiple citadel across kingdom of Almire](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland) was left unseen.

As far as current depiction of modified tortodrones allows, we would consider only Dark Matter-powered tortodrones as one belonging explicitly to Undercorp, while the rest of tortodrone variants would exist as a tangible possibility, which deviates from the _established motif of rage_.

#### Undercorp's Plot: Creation of Tortodrone

Weather the aforementioned equipment has existed by the time titans encountered Undercorp, we can more certainly suggest that both grim gates require resources larger than can be likely passed through the ritual circles even considering trnasportation of [Everfost Pillar during events of Heart of Ice](#ritual-circles-circle-of-art-pentacles).

Due to this we place grim gates and tortodrones temporally close, with the gates being the first, as they are the device to connect both realms. Only then tortodrones had to be engineered.

As tortodrones resemble bipedal tortoises, and the established timeline makes point on presence of tortomega civilization, here we suggest that tortodrones are based on tortomega design-wise, with the [Omega Shell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell) likely serving as the anatomical basis for tortodrones' shells.

Moreover, we can gather that invention of tortodrones was a collaborative effort. Curse is characterized by symbol of an opened eye, one present on tortodrone shell and, more importantly, on metallic helms and wing patterns of [Greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver). None of the ruins present across Clockworks and Wildwood have eye symbolism, apart from the [heavy statues](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Statue#Heavy_Statue), they will be kept in mind for further analysis.

Tortodrones are built in similar manner to Gun Puppies of tier 1 as [tortomega' stone constructs](#depictions-of-a-stone-dragon-gun-puppy). The main element, which ties both gun puppies and tortodrones is a _protective stone exterior and mechanical internals_ -- a [motif of stone](#motif-of-stone-and-serenity-titans).

_When tortodrone is defeated, it turns or more likely has stonr exterior, similar to a trojan_, one associated with the Legion of Ur and Underworld, but also containing dark matter crystal embedded into it. _Weather it is dark matter what influences this process of petrification, is unknown_, as the stone exterior is found for Gun Puppies.

At that, dark matter and general mineral relation is capable of this process of pertification. But, as inactive tortodrones are also found across Clockworks, and they are not seen as corrupted, we lean to tortodrones being constructed from stone in the first place, rather than becoming one through destruction of the supposed dark matter crystals.

Why tortodrones were manufactured? Most of the hints are located an the ancient grove and depth below -- Call of The Colossi, as well as Morgral'm memos.

In the same memos a staging area is mentioned - `An ID Card is required to access the staging area` ([Fiendish Memo (from Morgral'm)](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove)), -- it is a location through which both devilites and tortodrones are transported, as on the other side of the grim gates a dark city interior with vials and an inactive tortodrone is presented.

There are a few locations in the dark cities containing corrupted tortodrones as well as large deposits of dark matter in a seemingly more natural state, compared to the protected pillars in the Clockworks.

The very fact that dark cities with names derived of devilite culture are present in the Clockworks, as described in [dark cities section](#dark-cities), combined with larger grim gates and torn state of dark cities, it is safe to assume that those cities, unless they they were not devilites', came from the Underworld. This would require then either preexisting Undercorp colony, or there are transported through a much larger grim gates not seen in the Clockworks. In case of the cities arriving later in the timeline, grim gates still would remain as an important element to Undercorp's plot, involving tortodrones.

Considering that dark matter is found in those cities and laboratories, as two Devilish Drudgery scenario rooms:

- [First](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Devilish_Drudgery-Scenario_Room5A.png)
- [Second](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_2.png)

It is likely that tortodrones were at least _reconstructed, modified_ -- in the Underworld and delivered to the material realm, as well as allowing for dark cities to exist already by that point in time, potentially in the Underworld.

The original construction, which is the stone shell itself, the carvings of an eye and moving parts, judging by the rest of the Wildwoods, was done in the material realm by tortomega. If they were built in the Underworld, it is likely that they would've been made of the same metal that was used in weavers' helms made of metal -- with a symbol of a evil eye, as it is used often as an armor, making it expandable. Herein the shells contain eye imagery and made of stone lacking carvngs of corrupted tortodrones.

Why Undercorp would transport tortodrones? We suggest that this was done later, as part of Undercorp's plot to enter material realm. This likely led to a process of tempering tortodrones, deconstructing them, _engraving runes_, _imbuing with dark matter_ and _stitching back together_, and then finally sending them back to supress tortomega civilization.

In order to understand the process and details of such tempering and arguments in favour of this theory, we need to delve into construction and the anatomy of tortodrones.

#### Anatomy of Tortodrone and Crimsonite

At first, the relation between tortodrones and crimsonite had to be addressed.

There is Crimsonite, a mineral found across Clockworks, and used to power the gates, Clockwork gates:

- `A fabled mineral of a fiery, red color said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it` ([Crimsonite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimsonite#Crimsonite)).
- `A shard bomb stuffed with even more depleted Crimsonite` ([Super Shard Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Super_Shard_Bomb)), which means that Crimsonite can be depleted through a currently unknown process.
- `A large chunk of Crimsonite primed with a potent explosive. No more depleted Crimsonite here: this bomb's made with the good stuff` ([Deadly Shard Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Shard_Bomb)), crimsonite can be depleted, which seem to suggest that its explosive power is lesser, than non-depleted. This mineral property can potentially explain the darker shade of shard missiles launched by a tortodrone, which unleash areal damage.

Tortodrones, apart from their regular active state, have a rage state, [as depicted on mission card](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)).

As shard missiles are darker and still break down to regular crimsonite shards visually, this likely is the result of them being depleted. The crimsonite is `said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it` ([Crimsonite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimsonite#Crimsonite)). These shards are shot from the _pistons on top of tortodrone's shell_.

Based on the state of corrupted tortodrones, as they are powered by dark matter, we can guess that _regular tortodrones are powered by crimsonite_, evident by innate [aggro aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aggro_Aura#Aggro_Aura), one that is part of their engines, -- the [power pistons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Power_pistons) under tortodrone's shell. This means, likely both minerals -- __dark matter and crimsonite are potent enough to serve as power sources__.

In that sense [power pistons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Power_pistons) serve as tortodrone's engine, as they are __the only device and knight accessory providing aggro aura of red lightning__ and _the source of mineral bombardment_. That would suggest that shard missiles are weaponized unloading mechanism of depleted crimsonite used to power these constructs even in a corrupted state, despite being latter powered by dark matter.

Crimsonite is one mineral fed to drakon battle sprites. Those are remade by, supposedly, the Core into an image of [Dragons of Rage](#dragons). And, as tortodrone's arm cannon -- the [Grand Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist), -- deals normal damage and tortodrones are powered by crimsonite, we believe, it affirms the connection of tortodrones' power source and crimsonite crystals, same as how dark matter crystals were used to power corrupted tortodrones.

Tortodrones, as constructs, drop [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver) which is a connection to heavens and a possible refinement of the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore). Both linking to a concept of heaven, but also valkyries of heavenly kingdom. It is unknown how tortomega managed to acquire this resource, although it can be speculated that it was found.

Based on corrupted tortodrones' design, it can be concluded with certainty that their shells were deconstructed and _then stitched back together_. There are a few such locations seemingly designed to modify tortodrones with dark matter:

- [Drudgery](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/1/1b/Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_2.png)
- [Clockwork tunnels](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/a/a1/Scenario_Room-Clockworks_18.png)
- Imagery of opened portals within the grim gates containing vials and dark matter ritual circle.
- Several location of tortodrones placed into ritual circles across Clockworks.

The stitched shell has engravings of fiendish sigils on its plates. The central top piece is replaced with dark matter. Dark matter itself, as discussed earlier, is used to power tortodrone same as crimsonite. Considering that the sigils carved in the shell do glow, it is likely that those corrupted tortodrones are in their aggravated state, which has to be red for regular tortodrones and characteristic of aggro aura.

Across fiend sigils covering the shell all sigils, [only one](#sigil-of-a-cross), was unique, while the rest are seen across ritual circels, suggesting a _distinct purpose, important enouph to carve them over the eye symbol_.

Then there is [dark matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Shard) itself, it is likely that this is the only, if not most widespread, mineral found in the Underworld. There is a possibility of dark matter emerging due to devilite activity across realms, as a side effect of transportation, as this is the most recent mineral Spiral Order has discovered, as it mainly is used for alchemy of shadow-damaging weaponry and armor -- _the recency and inherent lack of understanding is impled by its name, as dark matter as reminisced of real world naming convension of dark matter_. If this mineral was as widespread as the rest, than Isorans were very likely to find it and discover shadow technology (`The Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research` - [Phantamos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos)).

Based on those ideas we can guess that at some point tortomega were taken advantage of, and through modification of tortodrones, remade as weapons, tortomega were annihilated. But, this process required capturing a tortodrone and tmpering with i, which may be a reason why there are still many tortodrones present in across Clockworks during the Long Migration, as wel las many instances of partially assembled tortodrones across clockworks accompanied by Underwolrd technology or perished gremlins.

The nature of the migration itself does remain untold, and we can safely suggest that this process consists of a search for the [veiled homeland](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland) of tortomega to which Ancient Grove had to relate at some point -- located in proximity of it geographically and the rest of the landmass comprising tortomega region of habitation, as stated in the beginning, -- being fractured.

#### The Titans, Tortomega, the Fall

As there are titans present both on the Clockwork gates and descriptions, the key role here, apart from mentioned [ancient titanic equipment](#symbolism-of-stone), are the titan gates.

The gates depict an entity with a single eye of familiar shape, reminiscent of Greavers' helm, holding its hands up, fixated on a sphere.

This seems to us as a most direct depiction of tortomega being related to Underworld, as there is no one working with the Underworld that close, even gremlins. During that time tortomega gained technological advancement through working with Undercorp. And that is before Undercorp sabotaged the technology, waging war on tortomega through modified tortodrones: `Investigations into the cause were inconclusive, but Spiral HQ suspects fiends are somehow involved` ([March of the Tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones)).

At that, we believe that [Heavy Statue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png) and titan gates are meant to represent one single entity -- a titan, armed with Underworld technology and equipment. They possess _ornament evil eye_ and [Troika](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika), a weapon suggested to belong to tortomega due to its ancient design and _accent on weight_. The further analysis will be concluded in relation to the presence of evil eye in its [own section](#evil-eye).

##### Fomorians and Irish Mythology

We will appeal to Irish mythology specifically, due to its later relevance in the context of Almire. Here, we are concerned with the story of Balor -- a one-eyed giant, a king of Fomorians, -- malevolent civilization from the Irish Underworld. Fomorians embody forces of chaos and destruction and are at war with pantheon of deities named Tuatha De Danann.

What is important here, is that across the myths, Fomorians were ones ruling over Ireland up to a mythological Battle of Mag Tuired until their defeat.

The other argument is related to the single eye symbolism. As titans are depicted as cyclops, and possessing a single eye of an helm, a connection to the eye of Balor could be made here. Balor's eye symbolizes evil and destructive power, conveniently similar to the dread seal, named here as the evil eye.

#### Minerals and Souls: Part 1

As it was established, dark matter and crimsonite can be charged. This ability allows minerals be used as a _power source for Clockwork gates_, _tortodrones' operation_, and _alchemizing explosives_ -- weaponized minerals in the similar notion of [grim gates' portal collapse being weaponized as vortex blocks and graviton bombs](#grim-gate-portal-collapse).

##### Introduction to Mineral Charge

At that, luminite also can be charged, as stated: `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite` ([Sun Shards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards)). As luminite has relation to the light and sun both in its description -- `A fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it`, -- and name as derivative of _lumen_, a visible light, those elemnts can serve as an explanation of a `solar-charged` state of Luminite of [Sun Shards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards).

Based on shard missiles of tortodrone-derived weapons, [Savage Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortofist) uses valestone in its alchemy, but the color of ammo suggests it being luminite, as it is usually yellow.

This change in color, apart from being a potential design inconsistency, can be resolved through later described tendency of minerals, once charged, to change color, as suggested by other weapons:

- _Sun-charged luminite is greener_, as seen in [Sun Shards bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards): `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite`. Luminite is used in recipe of the [Omega Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Tortofist).
- _Red shards of Crimsonite are not as dark in the missiles_ of [Grand Tortofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist), compared to the shards shot by a corrupted tortodrone. Tortodrone uses crimsonite projectiles from its core of power pistons, potentially as a weaponized mechanism of disposing depleted crimsonite.
- _Charged dark matter is pink_, it will be covered in [case of Arkus](#arkus-the-design) and [trojans](#trojans). It will be the foundation, through which we will develop the proposed here nature of minerals in [greater detail](#minerals-and-souls-part-2-mineral-charge) as we parse through the timeline.

This might suggest that mounted or equipped cannons use charged minerals as they are remade from tortodrones' designs as explicit weapons wielded by Spiral Order.

Based not on color but application through items' description we can make an extrapolation that __all minerals found in the Clockworks posses an internal charge, rendering them an applicable power source__.

##### Trojans: Everfrost and Dark Matter

The charge, -- a capacity to contain an amount of energy, -- potentially may be understood through a particular similarity between minerals and everfrost, in particular, the _physical and narrative properties of everfrost_.

Everfrost becomes central to the narrative of danger mission [Heart Of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice) in the form of [Everfrost Tower](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower): `Spiral HQ has detected a sudden climate shift emanating from deep within the Clockworks. Freak snowstorms and blizzards have begun surging through the depths seeming to originate from an inhospitable, fiendish city known as 'Amu-Sol.' The Recon Rangers have been dispatched to infiltrate Amu-Sol and discover the source of these freezing storms` ([Heart of ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice)):

- `large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison` ([Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower)).
- `A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` ([Fiendish Memo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol)).

When Everfrost Tower is found at its [corresponding depth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower) within Amu-Sol, appearance of everfrost is identical to Moonstone, but surrounded with ice. At the same time Maulos presents a fascinating study of effects of everfrost.

Moonstone and everfrost are separate minerals and their role in alchemy differs, yet _everfrost itself has similar properties to a mineral_ due to a common pattern:

1. Everfrost and minerals are capable of being arranged into a form of a pillar.
2. More similarities to minerals and everfrost are found by the fact that __everfrost is present in Maulos's back as the dark matter shard across trojans__.
3. Once Maulos is defeated, __everfrost shard shatters identical to dark matter of trojans__.

The similarities between Moonstone and everfrost are found through identification of Maulos as a trojan, which poses a question of trojans' nature -- __through which means dark matter or everfrost at that had become essential for trojans' animation?__

Whether everfrost and Dark Matter identical in their nature and influence, which takes a specfific observed effect on species of trojans, or it is a deliberate act of trojans' creation, -- in both scenarios the __common effect of those minerals on trojan physiology creates means of identifying everfrost as physically close to other minerals__.

##### Everfrost and Souls

Through the course of everfrost establishment as an important for Underworld mineral its capacity to contain souls becomes central to Maulos's plot. At that, everfrost is framed as supernatural in its origin: `A small patch of ice crystals that never seem to melt, even when exposed to direct heat` ([Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost)): `The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash swarms of angry, frozen souls into the Clockworks. Had he finished the job, well, I don't even want to think about how many sweaters we would all be needing right now` ([Heart of Ice - Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower)).

Here we have to acknowledge that souls imprisoned in everfrost does not constitute them being mortal -- souls may likely be eternal in most colloqual understanding, -- but rather everfrost seems as a trap, capable of intersecting with natural life-cycle of a souls, as a soul is held perpetually in everfrost.

Whether lost souls' _aggressive nature_ is inherent to their state, is unknwon, as we have found both sentient, non-aggerssive _lost_ souls, such as those related to Apocrean narrative.

In regards to dark matter, it is more mysterious mineral predominetly despite its larger screen time due to its framing and multifaceted application, even being reflected in its name as a _dark matter_, -- a _far more_ __utilitarian__ _name contrary to more established naming convension across fantasy minerals, such as Moonstone or Valestone_. The theme of utulity, then, ties back to themes of progress and industry of devilites, which we have discussed in relation to fuel of grim gates and ritual circles.

Yet, despite framing of dark matter as more mysterious, first through its name, followed by its application and association with Underworld and Undercorp, at the same time dark matter mineral is used as a food source for [Maskeraith](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith) battle sprite, making it relatively equal at least in application as other mineral-based sprite food, -- Crimsonite and Luminite, -- _surpassing the boundary of physiological differences between those battle sprites_ through a common association of them as _companions_.

While each of those sprite has different symbolic meaning and, potentially, physiology, all of them are derivations or mutations of the initial E-class battle sprite found on Skylark. This is an argument in favour of a _shared, common nature of dark matter and the rest of minerals_, apart from their initial application to be used to configure Clockwork gates.

Apocrean Realm is the other actor, which works with souls, and is seen to hunt and capture them as the [Apocrean Harvester's ability to drain souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Harvester). The above description, as we will discuss further, is closely similar to the idea of [Apocrean Engines](#analysis-of-apocrean-realm), as far as [Allister Danford's metaphors allow](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea): `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. Oh such beautiful souls! Bright and vibrant like fruit warming on the branch from a summer’s sun, longing for the pull of the earth below, the chance to seed and grow and birth anew`.

If:

- _everfrost can interface with souls_
- as _dark matter and other mineral are used as power source_;
- as _Apocrean narrative positions souls as fuel_;

__Could capacity of everfrost to interface with souls be extrapolated into the rest of minerals__?

Everfrost's proximity to minerals both through its narrative and physical properties can be seen as an emergent property, which deepens the worldbuilding aspect of the setting while providing means of explaining multiplle supernatural phenomena through a forming __symbolic framework__ _of a spiritual, yet transactional and quantifiable value of a soul_.

Those notions of power or energy of souls are refelctions of a single concept, most directly presented by Apocrean narrative -- __that souls are a medium for energy__.

##### Wisps and Energy

Sparks present a concept of wisps:

- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of technology and progress` ([Forge Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).
- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of darkness and decay` ([Grim Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).
- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of nature` ([Primal Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).

As those are quantifiable items -- sparks, -- they are characterized as wisps, and individually present a transactional value, a value derived of their fundamental nature.

While spirits' affiliations may evoke a similarity to planets in occult, `The Key of Solomon the King` in particular, we are interested in comparing those spirits with the minerals, which possess internal power, spirically, Valestone: `A fabled mineral of a vibrant green color said to contain the essence of all natural life` ([Valestone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valestone#Valestone)).

The idea of an essence being consiered a power, as it is present within Valestone is similar to idea of a spirit of nature of Primal Spark.

At that, the spark itself may be considered a medium of energy, not explicitly as a Spart of Life, but one which would relate back to the metaphysical soul, or aura at that, wherein the latter evidently possess energy as found through Black Kats' narrative, is another but more symbolic link to the initial idea of souls being a medium of energy.

##### Mineral Energy and Grim Gates' Power Source

Now, while keeping those concepts in mind, one more suggestion we must present. As known ritual circles utilize a mineral in their composition -- _does a mineral become an essential in order for ritual circle to perform its function_?

_Where ritual circle draws its power from?_ Is it a mineral itself or a shape or configuration of a pentacle?

We have a few evidence of this relation to energy:

- Aforementioned internal charge of a mineral, capable enough to be used in weapon production.
- Referring to other energy based systems, fiendish Sigils are ones that power grim gates through transmutation of fiendish ID card. Even if the card itself is the container for energy, for its transmutation sigils, which are depicted as essences, are still required.

As ritual circles are created from minerals, which so far are the only source of energy, we suggest that ritual circles tap into power of minerals to operate.

There are also Owlite tomes, which possess auras, which draw in Black Kats -- we will discuss the tomes later, as for now we will apply aforementioned concept as our primary method to interpret observed phenomena across Clockworks.

Then, as we have proposed earlier the _industrialisation of transportation -- from ritual circles to grim gates_, -- the importance of the shape of a pentacle itself may serve as a channel of mineral power for specific purposes, while the gates operate only for transportation.

Grim gates in that regard would become a technical achievement and an advancement, as devilite are not required to carry dark matter, as its energy in different form is present within _glyphs_ -- more [compact, efficient and multipurposed medium](#glyph-technology-data-and-energy-storage).

##### Power of Souls and Minerals

As everfrost is particularly similar to minerals, and minerals have to draw their power of a charged state from unknown source, with addition of devilite evolution of technology, we have arrived to a symbolic framework, where the energy becomes the foundation for souls, minerals and glyphs, wherein each of those quantifiable objects becomes a container for energy and means of its transportation and utilization through select means, a technology.

The mediums of that energy can be sentient, as souls and [wisps](#wisps-and-energy), and as minerals and glyphs.

If we add the technological advancement of Isorans to this system, we can identify the Energy which Spiral Order utilizes for operation of their weapons, as the most plausible identity of the aforementioned energy, potentially filtered through Isoran and gremlin technology as a recognizable blue-hued rectangular pattern.


<!--##### Rock Salt and Alchemical Primes

Apart from regular minerals, there is [Rock Salt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Salt): `A small amount of Clockworks mineral that's been infused with absolutely nothing. It hungrily draws at nearby essences and flavors, making it a staple in cooking, and the bane of jellies everywhere`.

While it is `infused with absolutely nothing`, it is a binding element of other, similar to role of Salt in Alchemy, binding other two of 3 Primes, being _sulfur_ and _mercury_.

The aspect of Salt to other primes is occasionally represented as a tool to unite the opposites, and more often a representation of a physical body, while unifying property is attributed to mercury. But, based of `It hungrily draws at nearby essences and flavors, making it a staple in cooking, and the bane of jellies everywhere` we can gather that this relation is different in the setting.

To address the line `infused with absolutely nothing`, -- does this mean that properties stated for the rest of minerals are far more literal, than initially implied, infused with elements, potentially represented in [sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens) -- Grim Spark, Primal Spark and Forge Spark?

- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of technology and progress` ([Forge Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).
-  `A small wisp of the essential spirit of darkness and decay` ([Grim Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).
- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of nature` ([Primal Spark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens)).

Sparks of Life in that context could represent pure energy, in also literal sense -- power of souls, -- which, at its core, is energy. More so, [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) provide a different perspective, but one which further taps into this idea of _souls being medium of energy_.

Luminite could be a stand-in for alchemical sulfur mainly through the [connection with the sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suns_in_alchemy), and not its Underworld counterpart -- [Brimstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brimstone). As sulfur symbolizes driving force, the spirit, or the will of a living being, luminite is described as `a fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it` ([Luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Luminite)), which sounds a drive for life, zeal, or even eros to dark matter's thanatos or death drive.

It can be argued that [valestone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Valestone) can be an in-universe counterpart to mercury, but it does not seem to have same relation to the Sun, as suggested by [Scintillating Sun Shards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scintillating_Sun_Shards): `A large chunk of solar-charged Luminite primed with a potent explosive`. As mercury represents consciousness, spirit, and soul, but also as a different inpterpretaion of a medium, which unites the opposites.

There are mercurial sets, such as [Mercurial Mail set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Mail) and [Mercurial Demo set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit). There aren't many leads, apart from accent on speed, similar to a concept of fluidity for the mercury in alchemy, and being made of valestone and crimsonite accordingly. The mercury, or rather quicksilver, as a substance is said to exist: `A fine set of mail made of what was once a Quicksilver` ([Quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail)), but, considering the context, it is more likely that quicksilver from the description is a [quicksilver lichen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver#Quicksilver). And, as mercury is more generally accepted representation for the union of opposites across many alchemical interpretations, we might reconsider rock salt as a representation of _physical stability_ between the elements, _a body, than a binding agent_. We will keep this distinction in mind until more elements will be revealed.

One element from the patterns found earlier we can attempt to distill. In alchemy, it was believed that minerals, through their properties correspond to spiritual aspects of the soul. And, minerals themselves possessed, in that framework, souls, which were more of a characteristics and qualities reflected in its physical properties.

Apart from those ideas, the theme of Rock Salt lacking infusion and through this attracting everything is also found in one other instance of the setting, it will be explored later.-->

#### Writings Of Amu-Sol

The writings, connecting treasure boxes on the solid ground around the everfrost tower would be not of rock salt or everfrost, as the circles glow, so we are left with an aforerementioned potentioal of moonstone being used.

And, as the entirety of the depth is covered with those _glowing writings_, as if protecting the tower, we would consider them being same as ones in the Ancient Grove. But, their color is different, ever so slightly. This cold pale color is consistent across all writings found in Amu-Sol, which, we believe, frames them as an intentional design choice in the context of the Amu-Sol's setting and ideas it is intended to convey.

As Rock Salt is used in [Shocking Salt Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Salt_Bomb): `For nutritional purposes, this particular chunk of salt has been enriched with dangerous amounts of electricity`, and the latter has arcs of electricity, we may attempt to link it to the patterns of the writings across [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice) depths -- intended to inspire electric motif disregarding their physical composition:

- Before Amu-Sol, [Frozen Highway](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Frozen_Highway) has those same elements used to connect Howlitzers, transforming them functionally into switches for the gates' grid.
- In [Amu-Sol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol) those patters are seen near mechanical switches and buttons.

While preserving _electrical motif_, those writings could be either of everfrost, rock salt, or moonstone.

- Due to absence of everfrost being used in this more mundane context, we would consider the writings across Amu-Sol being of salt or moonstone.

  But, as the Everfrost Tower itself is represented to be of moonstone, and due to ongoing motif of minerals being used in writing sigils, we lean to an idea of everfrost possessing similar properties, common across all minerals and being used here for the writings.

  At the same time, everfrost itself seemingly spreads ice, as suggested by the tower, unless it is the souls which cause low temperature. This is likely wrong, as [fire souls after Lord Vanaduke's passing don't cause perpetual fires](#corporeal-body).

  Among other encounters of everfrost, [Triglav](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav) is one most reminiscent of Amu-Sol's writings, as its core is exposed in pale blue light. Despite its lack of electrical motif, its [charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Triglav_Charge_Attack.png) is most similar to cases of magic found in Amu-Sol up to formations of ice.

- Rock Salt is seen in the [Pinch of Salt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Pinch_of_Salt) at the [Research Site](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Pinch_of_Salt#Gate_Map), wherein it is depicted exactly as on the inventory icon.

  A conflict may arise here, one related to the design of [salt bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Salt_Bomb), as it is very similar to [splinter bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Splinter_Bomb), which uses Luminite, but also is referred to as made of a synthetic mineral, yet capable of charge: `A large chunk of synthetic mineral primed with a potent explosive` ([splinter bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Splinter_Bomb)). This can be resolved through an assumption that the bombs also utilize charged minerals. Then, salt would change its color as seen with other minerals.

- Moonstone is seen to glow, paralleling dark matter ritual circles, and other previous examples, including Moorcroft Manor's ritual site.

  Moonstone is deeply related to electricity through the [recipes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blue_Shard#Usage). And yet, all of its items have a much greener hue or [deep blue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Neutralizer), compared to the color of writings found in Amu-Sol.

  Rock Salt of [Pinch of Salt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Pinch_of_Salt) at the [Research Site](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Pinch_of_Salt#Gate_Map) does not glow, which would most definitely explude it as a candidate for nature of glow at Amu-Sol or Ancient Grove.

Due to everfrost's themes and more explored applications of moonstone, we suggest that an underlying logic connects the two, but, as far as designs go, specifically of Triglav, mentioned earlier, we consider writings of Amu-Sol to be made of everfrost through its reaffirmation of the similarity of everfrost to minerals.

Through this connection the initial conflict of differing appearance of Everfrost Tower can be resolved.

#### Apocrean Ritual Circles

Where Underworld is present, there we expect ritual circles to be drawn. So far we have related the function of ritual circles to security and transportation. The circles are drawn with a select mineral.

For Underworld it is dark matter, potentially moonstone and everfrost. Earlier we have proposed a nature of the relation between properties of minerals and greater concept of a souls and energy as all being containers for a vague and omnipresent type of energy, which allows both for complex mechanisms and magic to function.

##### Lovecraftian Narrative

With this, we now have to move to the Apocrean Realm and its relation to the ritual circles.

In a reveal of appearances of the Apocrean Realm through adjacent to it location, there are [yellow or gold ritual circles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SotA-Gameplay_End.png) at the [Departure](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/Departure) and [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau) during [Shroud of Apocrea mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea_(Mission)).

Those patterns have [less common shape](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SotA-Gameplay_End.png), a floral pattern reminiscent of Nature Sprites' magic and [magic of Mystical Tome Stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand).

The circles are made of a yellow mineral, which so far lacks association with souls other than symbolic. We may identify it as [Luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Luminite#Luminite): `A fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it`, in order to reduce amount of unadaentified minerals, similar to the case of Everfrost Pillar and [glowing writings across Amu-Sol](#writings-of-amu-sol).

Apocrea, by being inspired by Lovecraftian deities, given this themes, may be preceived as one of the first civilizations, potentially preceding even Underworld, due to the nature of the source material, a _civilization as old as reality itself_.

If we to take this generalized idea of eldritch beings and apply to the setting, then _ritual circles would be one of the most ancient methods of using magic across known realms_ -- a notion we have suggested to exist at the beginning, as we [compared grim gates and ritual circles in their transportation capabilities and limitations](#summoning-from-underworld), but at significantly lesser scope of strictly Underoworld and introduction of this technology to civilizations of material realm.

Within this updated framing -- which includes Apocrean Realm, -- ritual circles could originate from Apocrean Realm, and only then be adapted by Underworld with more occult motifs applied onto them through `The Key of Solomon the King`.

This proposed reversal in the perception of the ritual -- as initially an eldritch device becoming one of colloqua means of communication with the immaterial and spiritual, with inclusion and base of eldritch existence, is reminiscent of the _occult motifs_ of South and West associtaed at their core with traces of eldritch beings on Earth of Lovecraft's initial fictional universe, _Yog-Sothothery_, reflected in character of `Abdul Alhazred`, `Joseph Curwen`, `Randolph Carter` and others who are presented as _bearers and practitioners_ of the knowledge recored in Necronomicon.

It is through those characters and their narratives an __exploration of effects of eldritch reality onto normalcy__ is performed.

In case of Spiral knights, Underworld and primarily Undercorp becomes so far the primary carrier of the occult or forbidden knowledge. There are other instances of a carrier, such as Owlites and to smaller degree gremlins, Almirians and Isorans, but as each of those civilizations relates back to Underworld due to nature of the _soul, energy and curse meachnics_, will be covered separately while deepening the image of Underworld as _far more expansive in its influence_.

This pattern of exploration, while negligible, we propse, also _manifests in relation and application of Dark Matter_ throughout aforementioned and yet unexplored narratives involving both Dark Matter itself, as well as other minerals.

##### Apocrea's Goal Of Negation of Existence: Part 1

Then it is the nature of Apocrean ritual circles which remains unknown. Why Luminite as the only gold-colored mineral was applied for those circles specifically, and given context of [Departure]() made _to be associated with souls_ apart from [minerals defining pentacle's application and function](#ritual-circles-circle-of-art-pentacles) as proposed in the analysis of [fiendish glyphs](#fiendish-glyphs)?

We offer a symbolic framework, which may tie Apocrea, souls and application of Luninite together.

Through Danford Apocrea is characterised as an agent of negation: `The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` ([Allister Danford, Dean of Antiquities](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

The primordial black is similar to the character Echo Stones give to the Swarm: `HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace)).

While the Swarm if not the focus the similarity of being _existential threats_ are a chared trait of both Apocrea and the Swarm.

The Luminite, which we identified as the only mineral of yellow color to exist in abundance, other than mineral of Core's gold keys, is described as `A fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it` ([Luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Luminite)).

As the souls are a desirable object of Apocrea's intent -- `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. Oh such beautiful souls`, -- to set up traps -- `The Apocrea are stuff of nightmares: a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life. Though you may venture beyond this nexus, you will undoubtedly fall into one of their traps along the way` ([Shroud of the Apocrea - The Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus)), -- and as souls are associated with thematically sun-based mineral, the __souls themselves become an extentions of that light__.

This is a classic in terms of themes scenario, which emerges from a confrontation of eternal light and darkness, but reframed through a culture of 21st century.

In particular, when perceived from a perspective of the living or any sentient entity which does not share Apocrea's intent, the presented existential threat of `return this cosmic to its primordial black` creates an environment or a narrative wherein a nuance of evil, herein being Apocrea and later the Swarm, is removed -- as Apocrea represents a power of _negation of existence in its conventional sence from perspective of the living_.

The `primordial black` while will be anayzed from a perspective of an alchemical narrative, most plausibly _disallows a nuance essential to complex existence_, hence we will refer to this narrative as one following [black-and-white morality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality), representative of an unredimable evil -- an actor of negation, -- positioned against a general good, -- all of the living, -- framed in a context of a battle for existence itself, _rather than_ for a control or reign over it.

##### Function of Luminite for Souls

There is a ray of light emanating from the floor surrounded by the circle, implying a portal, similar to the elevator's exit purple portal, which itself is identical to the portal which transports the knight to the [Obsidian Nexus]() in the first place. Through the portan consistenly harmless lost souls emerge upwards. While we are unaware of the nature of that portal, it offers a possibility of Apocrean realm ro be connected to other relams, including material realm, as well as potentially other realms, _if we were to extrapolate the instances of Apocrean purple portals as revealing deeper depths of Apocrean realm_.

For the knight, there are ritual circles placed an the entrance and exit elevator platforms, which may be interpreted both as means of _transportation_ and _warding_.

<!--The shape of those writings, as we earlier noted on the floral, nature-inspired motif, they are similar to magic belonging to the [Spirit Mother and Nature Sprites](#almire-and-spirit-mother), an aura, found surrounding the spirit wells of [Charred Court of Firestorm Citadel]().-->

The yellow ritual circles, potentially related to _act of protection_ or __weaponized captive function__ may be suggested by the several types of puzzles within the [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau) -- specifially, the locations, involving both purple ritual circles and gold, ones of Luminite, _which secure the souls_.

Among those circles there is a [pentacle of 3 stacked on top of each other, floating circles surrounding an obelisk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Devilite_Apocrea_Ritual.png), as this is the only instance of ritual circle being suspended, with a corresponding, albeit lesser in scale and complexity pentacle, surrounding another obelisk, [indicating placement of souls and made of Luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Level_Shroud_of_the_Apocrea_puzzle_tower_gold.png), a _behavior similar to everfrost and warding nature of ritual circles_ but utilized in the manner, which would allow to hold in-place [now-freed souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Freed_Soul#Freed_Soul).

The pattern of the dark matter pentacle, apart from summoning devilites once traversed, is most similar to a depiction of _alchemy orb with its 2 gold arms_. We make this connection due to other appearance of the stylized pattern of the orb of alchemy, such as [Tomes of Rage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_Rage), which contains this pattern on its cover. We will keep this tome and general design in mind, as we will discuss it in relation to Owlites.

If we assume that the nature of those circles is one of minerals, then it would provide more instances of minerals capable of floating, as their fragments freely surround the main body of a mineral pillar, and more importantly, elaborating on the _multipurpose application of minerals_.

While so far we have omitted the appearance and description of [freed souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Freed_Soul#Freed_Soul), we will keep them in mind as we discuss a particular _motif of chains_ and captivity both in relation to those souls, as well as other subtle instances of chains being a symbol of magical restrains.

#### State of Cradle Metaphysics

Owlites, Valkyries, and Kingdom of Almire are all far more aware of special damage types by the time Spiral Order discovers them in an environment where souls don't leave material realm on Cradle, and Spiral Order with Isorans existing for eons was not aware of supernatural aspect of nature of shadow nor elemental damage.

Then we have proposed that energy of the Core is the primary candidate for altered metaphysics of Cradle, as [explored through other than Skylark Isoran vessel during Ghost in The Machine danger mission](#cradle-metaphysics-part-1). More so, the spirits might not only return to material realm, but when their bodies perish on Cradle, they are either not allowed to move on into afterlife being Underworld or return back by instinct, causing haunting and reanimation as variants of zombies.

In order to draw out a single principle behind this effect of Core's activity, we have proposed that _the Core had_ __thinned the boundary between states of the living and death__, which would allow a gap of possibuility for undeath to exist beyond Cradle without Core's presence without causing breakage of internal logic, as well as acknowledge at that point the outliers such as permanent undeath of kingdom of Almire.

_For the living,_ __presence of the Core amplifies life__ and [transcends time](#technology-alchemy-and-isoran-redesigns) _reminiscent of Isoran alchemy without a catalyst_ but through its own omnipresent and [foundational nature as energy](#energy), manifested as reincarnation of [battle sprites](#battle-sprites-energy-signature), tiers of Clockworks and existence of mist energy as a sign of _energy excess_ within Isoran narrative.

<!--If we had to develop this idea further, we would suggest the Core and consequently Cradle becoming a point in space where multiple realms intersect, similar to a concept of a World Tree -- __Axis Mundi__, -- through presence of Energy, which, if not unifies, at least connects those realms under a harmonic topology, contrary to Underworld-adjacent and Apocrea's invasive presence within material realm.-->

After this we have covered devilite activity and similarity of everfrost to minerals, [proposing a fundamental common nature between minerals and everfrost](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), manifested and utilized in multiple methods, including powering tortodrones and ritual circles, wherein the latter drew its power from charged state of minerals.

The charge of mineral is derived from it being a container for the same type of energy, which provides value to souls for them to [power Apocrean Engines](#apocreas-goal-as-negation-of-existence), eventually leading to the idea of Energy, which Spiral Order utilizes -- being a potentially refined universal Energy, -- which provides utility power and value to souls, wisps, devilite glyphs, and minerals.

Within this logic we proposed the [nature of an aura and a soul are distinclty separate](#auras-and-souls), wherein an aura is the manifestation of a body, -- in material realm being a physical shell, such as bones, or a [book tome](#auras-and-tomes). In the material realm aura is physical, while the soul offers the core identity and a potentially eternal will to stay within material realm or to move on.

Through nature of Black Kats we have proposed that aura, as much as a soul, is a container or a medium for universal energy, which provides it power to exist, and as much as for souls, granting them value.

##### Omnipresence of Undeath

The events of all of so far covered kingdoms are framed in a genre of fantasy, be it a cursed kingdom of Almire, mythology-inspired valkyries of heavenly kingdom, tortomega as forest titans, pre-industrial interventions of Underworld, or dark halls of a fallen Owlite Academy of Magics.

Then there is the Core concealing Whitespace as completely alien to any other location, and the rest of Clockworks which hold and contain aforementioned individual regions. With the Core, the rest of megastructure -- Clockworks, -- is grouped together under current assumption of being man-made creation -- gremlins'.

If we consider a possibility of the Whitespace in unknown physical appearance to exist prior to construction of the Core around it not as a gremlin technology but, given its effects onto reality, a preexisting phenomenon, how ot would be possible and where are its limits?

Could pre-Core existe of Whitespace, given motif of Heavens for valkyries and by magnitudes greater presence of magic, compared to accounts of Isorans affirmed by their age as an interstellar civilization, explain those notions?

As there are only a few signs of the nature of existence outside of Cradle, most of which come from extrapolated Isoran past, operations of Undercorp, and Apocrea's plan, assuming latter's operation being unaffected by its entrance located in proximity of the Core.

Through this logic, as the Core conceals Whitespace, we could plausibly include preemptive existence of this life-animating influence on nearby civilizations through their abundant connection with supernatural on modern Cradle, compared to the rest of existence, if those civilization originate from a single location, a precursor to mechanical Cradle.

This would frame the events involving souls and undeath as potentially unique to Cradle's metaphysics, rather than a universal principle.

Both this scenario and the initial proposal of omnipresence of undeath can be acknowledged through aforementioned effect of the Core as collapsing the boundaries between dimensions and metaphysical states. Albeit here the _acknowledgement of souls as components of a natural life-cycle being mundane_ as framed through Undercorp and Apocrea make us to commit to interpretation where undeath and supernatural existence are omnipresent, rather than a unique to Cradle phenomena.

With this, we should focus on the nature and function of _Mysterious Consoles as interfaces of the Core_, and subsequently, Core's capabilities, as once seen in relation to Almire's resurgence of curse coinciding with Console's activation. Through this ongoing track we will attempt to identify the limits of Core's Energy-based influence and eventually resolve the ambiguity of its function, nature and role.

#### Consoles: Part 1: Gremlin Containments and Consoles

Gauntlet's second depth is a deconstruction zone with a name `Reign of Fire` and characteristic presence of gremlins. It is followed by Gauntlet's last depth -- [`Last Stand`](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand). It has architecture of the Scarlet Fortress and has gremlins present at the final, fire-themed arena, accompanied by constructs.

As in the [analysis of Ghost in The Machine danger mission](#ghosts-in-the-machine), we propose that gremlins' presence connects the corresponding location to them. We propose that this pattern of gremlin presence is not a coincidence, but an intentional design choice guided by a yet unfolding narrative, part of which constitutes _gremlins to guard the Firestorm Citadel at the_ [Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet), __as a point of interest harboring undeath__.

This hypothetical practice exists along with a different tendency -- of a specific placement of consoles.

Firestorm Citadel has itself a dedicated room with a mysterious console embedded behind the throne room, which does not seem accessible from the outside of the molten cavern the citadel resides, as the rest of its residence is guarded by Lord Vanaduke. Citadel became a significant element of rank missions, as it hindered further access to the Core: `The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).

Does that mean that the console and Clockworks were already present before [kingdom of Almire had fallen](#king-in-the-mountain)? Same logic can be applied to the Royal Jelly Palace, as the artifact console is also present there, embedded into the stonework floor behind throne room. More so, Royal Jelly Palace has modern technoloy embedded into its grounds -- as pipes and search lights. Through this context of potentially external intervention, consoles must be looked at, as this pattern of being hidden behind the throne rooms is particularly notable.

We must keep in mind that Royal Jelly Palace belongs to the main structure of the Scarlet Fortress and, by extension, heavenly kingdom, based on its architecture.

Consoles' design has a subtle common element with Clockwork elevators -- _its holographic monitor panel's sides have practically identical design to Clockwork Elevator side panels_ of __3 short cylinders extending from the edges in radial manner__, _a characteristic element of gremlin technology across Clockworks_. Moreover, the [runes present on the mysterious console and artifact seem to be the same as on the Roarmulus Twins' armor plates](#gremlin-conlang). This language of gremlins will be covered in the [gremlin conlang section](#gremlin-conlang).

This makes it seem that these consoles were strategically placed into those appropriate locations. Yet, the time period remains undefined -- when those consoles were build and _why such symbolically significant location were chosen_?

The console of [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay) may have been placed in the Citadel after it had burned. Royal Jelly Palace was overtaken by alien jellies family of monsters, which also represents an alien danger to gremlins. On the contrary, could it be _that this exact danger_ -- as Lord Vanaduke, and as Royal Jelly, -- were to be the reason for such specific placement?

__There is a theme of monarchy, of throne rooms, and a notion of castles of past civilizations serving as keystone locations to accessing the Core and gremlin civilization with its own monarchy__ _represented by a figure of king Tinkinzar_.

This narrative incorporates gremlins through the myth of gremlin king Tinkinzar as a single link between gremlins and a concept monarchy, weather or not he exists. It allows for identification of an outline of a currently indistinct set of symbols, themes, where consoles' purpose exists beyond practical value, but symbolic.

<!--At the same time, we'll relate to an earlier proposal, one that postulates that the Core is responsible for the physical connection to Underworld over material realm and a tendency for spirits to return into material realm.-->

One console is placed into citadel of Almire, and the other within valkyrian halls of the scarlet fortress. If consoles and Clockworks were built at the time of those civilizations' living existence, this would frame gremlins as one of the most ancient civilization to exist during reign of those kingdoms while possessing formidable skills and technology surpassing the prior.

Such scenario would lead the Core and Clockworks to exist _at some extent_ during those civilizations' reign, which seems unlikely due to _a lack of non-thematic advanced technology in the narratives revolving around those civilizations_. This placement of consoles would seem accurate for them to be protected, suggesting that gremlins were building Clockworks or at least were introducing those consoles to alien civilizations with the Core already requiring such security measures, evident by consoles' _sophisticated function and a shared, consistent with the Artifact design_.

Yet, as no explicit connection to those time periods apart of an surface-level idea of a gremlin king is revealed so far, as there is no any meaningful evidence of such scenario existing at least at this point of the analysis, we lean to consider consoles to be built later by gremlins in conjunction with creation of the Core as a gremlin technology _on top of ruined kingdoms_.

And, if the consoles were installed later, as the civilizations in charge of these castles are gone, gremlins would have ability to traverse those environments -- devoid of Owites Royal Jelly Palace, but already burning Firestorm Citadel, -- as those are the narrative states those civilizations, as far as we are aware, had ceased.

As for Herex in the context of Shadowplay and current proposal, we will discuss him during the analysis of the [exact mechanics of the Artifact](#artifact-console-and-a-hatch), but here, taken our later analysis of his actions, we lean to an idea of him entering the citadel after knights have defeated Lord Vanaduke solely due to ceasation of the primary threat, compared to Citadel's still burning state, perpetuated by lingering presence of Lord Vanaduke -- `You can feel it in the smoldering air - an eternal will holding this place together, never allowing its inhabitants to rest. No creature deserves such a fate, it is beyond my understanding` ([Recon Module: Firestorm Citadel - Grantz](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)). And that is taking in account that Herex seemingly arrived with a squad of gremlins and construicts into the Citadel past the Throne Room. This will be also discussed in the [chapter on gremlins](#chapter-ix-gremlin-empire).

Another question we should address is the existence of Clockwork elevators across Scarlet Fortress, Royal Jelly Palace and Firestorm Citadel.

That is, are they present in the historical context of those locations? Within current framework they are, and have dedicated icons of the regions designed by gremlins themselves to navigate through. This would mean that gremlins at least in the past had ability to handle those environments while utilizing their dangerous traits to secure the consoles.

If the console being installed later, as the Citadel was burning, while allowing for Herex's traversal, we could explain it by the sheer manpower of gremlins during, seemingly, [more stable period of time](#battlepods-and-laser-technology), while Clockworks were still under construction.

This arrangement of events may seem contradictive, as the Citadel is framed as an impenetrable and eternal cursed fortress, and yet it is the only plausible explanation for presence of such advanced equipment within a medievalitic setting without creating a sequence, where gremlins, and by proxy the Core, were present during reign of both civilizations, separated by a thousand years or more.

#### Evil Eye

Across Cradle there is a perpetual, yet subtle presence of an eye, mainly recognized in its 2 distinct designs:

- An _antique design_, seen across:

  - _Heavy statues_
  - _Graviton Bomb's front-facing plate_
  - _Transmuted gear of Kat tribe_
  - __Apparition of Graviton Bomb's explosion__
  - __Apparition of Collector's explosive attack__
  - __Collector's face plate surrounding the ocular__

- A _featureless_ eye, commonly associated with:

  - _Shadow Lairs' icon_
  - _Curse status effect_
  - _Sealed Sword and its seals_
  - _Black Kat seals_
  - _Tortodrones' shells_ at an enraged state
  - _Tortodrone-derived Spiral Order equipment_
  - _Enemy gates across the Core_
  - _Nefarious gear_
  - __Greavers' helm__
  - __Greaver wings' color patterns__

We were referring to both instances of an eye collectively as the evil eye in order to bbroadly identify this motif.

As far as eye's presence allows, the design stems from Underworld, and meant to represent Underworld's presence across material realm.

The evil eye design first appeared across [greavers' helms and wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver), and later applied to tortodrone shells. The __organic appearance on Greavers' wings__, we propose, is the primary argument in favour of the symbol originating from Underworld as, potentially, a simple pattern with no inherent metaphysical role. Only after Underworld had adopted this pattern and imbued it with symbolic value, it bacame representative of Underworld, of curase and adjacent concepts throughout culture's development.

Eventually, it was adopted by Underworld's army as Greavers' helm was engraved with this eye, and as tortodrone stone shells were designed with this symbol in mind, only being revealed at tortodrones' enraged state. This development is reminiscent of _symbol of a spiral_ [as it was adopted](#omnipresence-of-the-spiral) _across the material realm_. But, as symbol of a spiral plausibly has metaphysical meaning, we would not discard such possibility for the eye, albeit with a lesser chance.

#### Heavy Statue and Antique Evil Eye

We propose that the _antique_ instance of an evil eye is the result of the collision of cultures -- introduction of Underworld and its occult physicality to titans' civilization, which had resulted in integration of fiendish evil eye into titans' designs, _as no Underworld-native object other than potential Graviton Bomb possess antique eye appearance_.

As a potential sign of this connection with the Underworld, this transition was depicted in [Heavy Statues](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png), when titans were [still utilizing](#unreconciled-duality-of-fury-and-serenity) the heavy cleaver-like weapons such as [Troika](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika).

Why heavy statues have _ears similar to fiends' of fiend family emblem_? Our guess is is use usage of the greavers' helm, adapter for draconic, or rather, tortoise-like anatomy of titans, as tortomega. And despite this, the design itself had remained the same, as it has essential to it elements, as devilite ears, and, of course, the eye, features meant to convey the cultural alignment.

This depiction of titans, armored in Underworld equipment, yet still related to stone, had to be seen by gremlins in order to draw _gates' icon with their imagery_. Moreover, we can identify the precise details of this supposed Underworld armor.

This might be a lead to a greater presence of cyclopean entities with a single eye. From those mythological entities the single-eyed helm could've been designed. On par with it, there is a theme of transformation -- embodied by gorgos, notably, with a single eye. [Gorgo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo) are already referred in the [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist): `A terrifying handgun that combines the dual-crushing power of a gorgo and the mythical tortomega`.

If we are to take this idea even further the single eye design with a jagged mouth below -- an anatomical trait of gorgos, -- is also found far later into the timeline and will be properly attributed, as the Collector has the similar feature-rich design, comprised of an antique eye and a painted spiked mouth below it, while being one of constructs which directly tap into Underworld's symbolism.

There are other gremlin-adjacent entities with cyclopean motif: [gremlin elite scorchers or incenerators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scorcher#Gremlin_Incinerator) and Swarm's ["avatar"](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-The_Core-The_Path_is_Revealed-2.png) encountered at the beginning of Dreams and Nightmares' [Path Is Revealed depth above the Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed).

Evidently, this motif of an eye persists over the ages across Cradle _and relates back to Underworld_.

#### Grim Totems: Part 1

The eye symbolism as an initially organic design from Greavers' wings may contribute to a general _anatomical motif_ of Underowld devices prior to Undercorp -- specifically, faces of grim totems and faces of locked enemy gates across Clockworks. Grim totems will be later analyzed in the context of Almire. But, one concept worth mentioning here is the potential relation of grim totems to the [state of Cradle as allowing for spirits to return into material realm](#cradle-metaphysics-part-1).

Both totems and undead Dreadnoughs possess a power to resurrect fallen zombies _from their skulls_. The role of the skull becomes more important as we are reminded of the [skulls' haunting by lost souls](#lost-souls-with-skulls), which follows the idea of a souls' need to reside within a body in order to _exude a degree of control over material realm_, as [the body, in the material realm being manifestation of the aura](#corporeal-body), is the arrangement of bones.

At that point we would suggest that the ability to resurrect emerges from a manipulation with the recently severed connection of a souls to a body as one capable of being mended in a similar method of potentially ceased gremlins being _revived_ by a [gremlin mender](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mender#Darkfang_Mender).

The exact meachanics of this process are yet to be understood, the role of souls within this system seems central, particularly important.

#### Monster Doors: Security Flaw of Clockworks

The other seemingly soul-based concept is tied to the [Monster Doors](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Monster_Door.png).

If devilites did work with gremlins, then monster doors would have a high possibility of belonging to them. The door has the same anatomical, facial design with a familiar lightning arcs, which will be later discussed in the [context of trojans](#legion-of-ur). The idea of gates deactivating when no enemies are present, and attributed as such to a generic evil design, can have a meaning befitting to Underworld.

Then, the application of this design across entirety of Clockworks with an exception of the Core may be explained as follows.

Existence of souls, their acknowledgement, as well as later themes regarding capabilities of soul-manipulation may point to a soul-fueled operation of Underworld devices, and for doors it is _a mechanism, reacting on presence of an intruder_.

As there is a [framework of energy and minerals being related, as souls provide a source of energy](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), the possibility of direct integration and consideration of those principles into those designs is not discarded, albeit not intentionally.

Within this framework gremlins' connection to Underworkls and Undercorp in particular can be used as an explanation of the __widescale application of Underworld technology across Clockworks__ while building up a narrative of Undercorp attaining an unprecedented control over megastructure's operation, __reminiscent of tortomega__ and their [eventual annihilation by hijacked tortodrones under Undercorp's control](#the-titans-tortomega-the-fall).

As far as we can predict the future development of megstructure without analyzing gremlins proper, within such narrative, __the megastructure is severely compromised__.

#### Cradle Antagonists

Among distinct characters aligned with Underworld or Undercorp we have previously selected Morgral'm and Maulos. Then we have proposed existence of [fiendish cults](#fiendish-cults) and a faction of gods inhabiting Underworld which possess themes of natural elements, in particular:

- Vog as a deity associated with fire
- Unnamed deity associated with poisons, whom we labelled the Vile Deity
- A hypothetical deity of frost -- Hail Deity, -- proposed to exist due to similarities between Lord Vanaduke and Maulos, as an extrapolation of Lord Vanaduke's connection to Vog

All of those deities incorporate undeath and _supernaturally fatal_ nature of their respective elements.

Then we have shortly [hypothesized on the meaning](#glyph-names-and-metaphysics-of-color) of trojan legion's name -- Legion of Ur, -- [proposing a naming convention](#name-of-ur) which frames `Ur` as a word used as a characteristic title within speculative fiendish language.

Yet, the role of an antagonist across all narratives was forming initially vaguely around Underworld, followed by a Undercorp due to latter's distinct actions. Despite this characteritic of Undercorp, we do not possess knowledge on the goals of Undercorp's expansion into material realm, unless we would include the Core as a source of energy more refined than souls, which contributes to energy-based operation of Underworld, identical to the premise of Isorans' goal to capture this source of energy.

While Undercorp may be seen as a recurring villian within the narrative, and its goals remain ambigious, Apocrea becomes a defined, less present but magnitudes more threatening long-term antagonist, as [its goals conflict with currently established structure of reality](#apocreas-goal-as-negation-of-existence).

Among those entities exists one more figure, which may be identified as a greater antagonist emerging from Underworld -- `Nefarious Imp`.

#### Nefarious Imp

Nefarious Imp is established through its gear:

- `A raiment said to be crafted by a nefarious imp. The ethereal plates will defend against heinous harassment while they shroud you in darkness` ([Nefarious Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Raiment)).
- `A hood said to be crafted by a nefarious imp. The floating hood is certain to cloak you during clandestine campaigns` ([Nefarious Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood)).

The gear connects motif of evil eye and armor reminiscent of [Kat tribe equipment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_kat_raiment), as both possess symbol of the eye, but only Nefarious Gear has a distinct variation of the eye, _identical to symbol of curse, with 3 radial lines extending below the eye downwards_.

The eye is incorporated in armor's design in the most advanced manner found so far -- compared to smithwork of Kat tribe armors, Imp's armor and helm use a different metal, most reminiscent of [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_faust), wherein _both incorporate a similar pattern of inner angular contour and an eye with its horizontal line extending to the sides_.

And, as Gran Faust utilizes Shadow Steel -- `an upgraded Faust forged from pristine-quality shadow steel` ([Gran faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_faust)), -- forged in the Underworld -- `A powerful, cursed sword forged in the underworld` ([Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust)), we can identify imp's armor as created from the [Shadow Steel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Steel): `An extraordinary metal imbued with the creeping darkness of the Underworld`. The `creeping darkness of the Underworld` given context of [graveyards](#graveyards) and other locations falling into Underworld, we would consider _a tangible metaphysical essence_.

In that regard of exploring devilite designs, a similar to contoured design is found on [Wicked Idol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol), which possesses a _more alien and technological design of symmetrical curved lines across figure's surface_.

<!--We have previously proposed in the [analysis of Apocrean Circles](#apocrean-circles) that the darkness of Underworld or even Apocrea is the same darkness Sleeper was referring to. Here we have another instance of darkness referred to as a metaphysical presence. Shadow steel is described as `An extraordinary metal imbued with the creeping darkness of the Underworld`. While we will not commit to this concept, its peculiarity - its themes, framing of darkness is something to remember.-->

As [Wicked Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Prize_Box) is the source of Nafarious gear, we may veiw it from a perspective of being connected both to Nefarious Imp and Underworld.

Its announcement, [Something Wicked This Way Comes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/110021), states: `Today Spiral HQ introduces a line of gear that should help you blend into environs riddled with cursed monsters. We bring these to you in the Wicked Prize Box, with contents including the following: Wicked helms, Wicked armors, Wicked accessories, Crest of Curse (new), Nefarious Hood (new), Nefarious Raiment (new)`. Through this identification with curse, we can characterize nature of curse as `wicked`, further implied by presence of [Crest of Curse](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Curse#Crest_of_Curse) within box's item pool, which depicts a variation of symbol of curse of minimalist design with purple circle, reminiscent of Obsidian Nexus, although this could be a coincidence.

Yet, in that hypthetical relation to Apocrea, we should point out a similarity of this rendition fiendish armor, with its accent on the eye, to surface-level, predominetly western, pop-culture reimagining of culture of Ancient Egypt as related to eldritch deities.

While we won't elaborate on the history of this concept, we acknowledge its presence -- both in the 20th century through H.P. Lovecraft's depition of Nyarlathotep (`Fungi from Yuggoth`, `The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath`, `Nyarlathotep`), and modern franchises, -- it is a direction, we believe, worth considering as a potential, if indirect, influence on those select few design decisions.

Lastly, the items frame the imp in a specific manner -- `A raiment said to be crafted by a nefarious imp` ([Nefarious Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Raiment)), -- utilizing a language which emphasizes on this act of creation as a folktale or a legend, similar to:

- `A plated robe said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` ([Arctic Acolyte Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle)).
- `A plated mail said to be crafted in the image of a venomous fiend. It comes with a sinister skin suit that pulses with a vile essence` ([Venom Fiend Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Fiend_Mail#Venom_Fiend_Mail))

The singular use of a figure `imp` coupled with a character trait of `nefarious`, we suggest, emphasizes its individuality -- a single imp, responsible for creation of that armor made of Shadow Steel. Individuality of Nefarious Imp may be further established by a similarity to description of Arctic Rogue gear:

- `A mask said to be crafted by an arctic rogue. The shattered ice will conceal your identity during clandestine arctic expeditions` ([Arctic Rogue Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Rogue_Mask)).
- `A plated mail said to be crafted by an arctic rogue. It comes augmented with ice plating to conceal your location during arctic expeditions` ([Arctic Rogue mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Rogue_Mail)).

As Artcic Rogue gear appears damaged, which within the narrative Glacial Prize Box offers, we suggest, might imply ownership by a single person, which had eventually defected, a rogue, _rather than a mass-produced armor_.

As for nefarious gear -- it is designed with secrecy and concealing of presence of the wearer in mind:

- `shroud you in darkness` (`A raiment said to be crafted by a nefarious imp. The ethereal plates will defend against heinous harassment while they shroud you in darkness` - [Nefarious Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Raiment)).
- `during clandestine campaigns` (`A hood said to be crafted by a nefarious imp. The floating hood is certain to cloak you during clandestine campaigns` - [Nefarious Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood)).

Through above connection to curse and advanced designs which incorporate symbol of specifically curse, we propose that Nefarious Imp is one of a few potential antagonists behind propagation of Underworld potentially separate from intentions of Apocrea.

##### Arctic Plot

The design of nefarious gear suggests that this Imp is most connected with the evil eye symbolism of Underworld. [Nefarious Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood), on the other hand, is reminiscent of Apocrean cultists' [Obsidian Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Hood_of_Rituals). In that regard a different narrative may be found, revolving around items of [Glacial Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box). The narrative of Glacial Prize Box coupled with arctic designs -- evil eye symbol on armor's belt, -- allows for a _connection to be established between occult of Underworld and lovecraftian storytelling_, specifcally as [`At the Mountains of Madness`](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness)-inspired premise.

Apart from [Arctic Rogue set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Rogue_Mail), there is Arctic Acolyte:

- `A plated robe said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` ([Arctic Acolyte Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle)).
- `A hood said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` ([Arctic Acolyte Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Hood)).

As Arctic Rogue design possesses spirals, we would suggest its owner to be Isoran. Through grouping of Arctic Rogue and Arctic Acolytes, we can assume that acolytes were also Isoran in their physiology, eventually leading to a developed idea of _members of Spiral Order defecting in favour of Apocrea_ in a manner, similar to _Danford_ as the most detailed and thematically-accurate example.

It is here lovecraftian narrative starts to unfold without direct presentation of Apocrean Realm. Given mysterious nature of acolytes, their purpose and similarity to Apocrean-obsidian gear, we can with high precision point out an implicit connection to Apocrea. And through this connection we can explain the __initial arctic theme__ _as it coincides with the premise_ of [`At the Mountains Of Madness`](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness). Other than this plot point of eldritch horror and frost being grouped together, _the Arctic narrative remains open-ended_.

##### Return to Blinding Abyss and Maulos

But, given preexisting narratives, eldritch presence, and existing plots which either do not possess a distinct beginning or are related to frost, we can speculate in attempt to link those narratives back to Arctic Acolytes.

Event of summoning Maulos as a phenomenon of supernatural frost may be related to Apocrean Cultists and by extension Arctic Acolytes, as Acolytes must possess a reason to traverse into `frozen continent`, while devilites of Maulos's cult had to possess an initiation of the cult and a focus on supernatural frost.

This Arctic expedition can be vaguely connected to [Maulos's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maulos#Maulos) sudden appearance, as it was likely summoned as a trojan, yet motivation of a cult surrounding Maulos evidently misaligns with goals of Undercorp: `Provided summary of need for requested resources: 'All hail the great and terrifying Maulos, true lord of the Blinding Abyss'; Please note that 'All fall under the freezing corruption of the great Maulos' is not an acceptable description of current executive hierarchy; 'The freezing corruption of lord Maulos is inescapable'` ([Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memo - Morgral'm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol)). This is a speculation, which attempts to tie those loose ends. Further on we will address an issue of Maulos's existence with current knowledge of Underworld' presence and Undercorp's operations on Cradle.

The act of bringing back Maulos could be a continuation of the same methodology of bringing back trojans from Underworld through the ritual circles. Yet, if such scenario would be true, it seems unlikely that Undercorp would attemtp to stop this process and at such scale, involving a devilite city.

Apart from lovecraftian inpirations, we suggest that events surrounding the state of Amu-Sol are potentially inspired by appearances of __Frozen Throne__ from _World of Warcraft_ universe.

Within this interpretation Maulos becomes the stand-in for Lich King Arthas while the Everfrost Tower becomes reaimagined Frozen Throne. Notably, the intermediate phases of Maulos's fight involve him retreating into a block of ice, reminiscent of Ner'zhul being bound within the Frozen Throne, while inner glow of Maulos's mace is reminiscent of Frostmourne, as a unique weapon, potentially similar in its operation to [Triglav](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav), as the latter near-seamlessly incorporates everfrost.

At that, the [intial proposal](#perma-frostifurs-and-blinding-abyss) of Blinding Abyss being at the bottom or below of colloqual underworld and Underworld of Spiral Knights, likely requires a similar ritual to summon Maulos into material realm as trojans, wherein Blinding Abyss is reframed as a potential _prison dimension_ or a significantly different region of Underworld in order to be acknowledged by devilites by a distinguished name.

This logic does not explain the reason behind Maulos unique physiology -- as affliction by everfrost, -- which at that point might remain in the same state of ambiguity as [prior discussion on existence of elemental tortodrones](#tortodrone-equipment), nor immortal nature of Perma-Frostifurs, -- as both are built on top of thematic identification of Blinding Abyss as a realm of supernatural frost and a set of parallels between Lord Vanaduke and Maulos.

The framing of Maulos as a lord of Blinding Abyss does not reveal, whether devilites themselves had recently created Maulos as a unique everfrost-bearing trojan or Maulos was summoned as such from Underworld or Blinding Abyss.

If Maulos was affiliated and imprisoned within Blinding Abyss, then his transformation into everfrost-bearing trojan had to happen in the past -- prior to imprisonment of Legion of Ur. Otherwise, depending on the inclusion and degree of inspiration with the narrative of Frozen Throne, Maulos could have been transfomed only recently, albeit his nature as a trojan would introduce a nuance before drawing parallels between both characters.

For now we will commit to a scenario, where Blinding Abyss is representative of supernatural frost and prison for Maulos, from which he was summoned as a trojan by devilites, as such scenario will:

- Avoid complex mechanics of trojans being transfigured by introduction, replacement or transformation of their Dark Matter mineral;
- Explaining Maulos's sudden apperance in the story as a summoned, powerfull on his own unit of Legion of Ur. And it is his unique physiology of being powered by everfrost which grants him power and frames him as a significant enough threat to be sealed in the depths of Underworld, called Blinding Abyss.

##### Operation Gelid

At the same time, presence of Spiral Knights' armor within the [Glacial Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box) roster might suggest that Imp could be involved though the design similarities to the apocrean gear. Those being:

- `A plated robe said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` ([Arctic Acolyte Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle)).
- `A hood said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` ([Arctic Acolyte Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Hood)).

Notably, in the [forum post](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/107155), which is an in-universe email, it is said that `Spiral HQ has embarked upon OPERATION GELID. An assortment of items are available to you, including the following`, which in the above context might mean that _Spiral HQ has an undisclosed relation to Underworld and Apocrea_, possibly resulting in the events of [Heart of Ice](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice), and at least an expedition into the frozen continent.

On the contrary, operation Gelid while is set in a frost-themeed context, exists separately from defected knight and acolytes, being a simpler solution, wherein Spiral Order is oblivious to the context of those items.

Lastly, Nefarious Imp remains a one-time figure appearing only through a costume set. While we would not identify him as a distinct force which coordinates Underworld in general, his nefarious characteristic, secrecy and association with curse makes us to consider him as a potential candidate for that role of an antagonist existing side-by-side with Apocrea as we analyze other _inexplicable instances of Underworld's presence_.

#### Strangers and Haven

Strangers are one of more illusive civilizations on Cradle despite direct interaction of Isorans with them during the aftermath of Skylark crash landing.

In order to understand them, we will start from their currently known town, Haven.

Haven itself is a rather unique location. It is a small town seemingly built on the slope of a mountain. Inside the mountain is the Arcade -- a _large Clockwork terminal_ with an access to the Clockwork gates, which pathways eventually _converge at the Core Terminal_.

We can suggest the Arcade being inside of the mountain based on the goal of Project Roarmulus -- `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade! Based on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the strangers should it reach the Arcade.` ([Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)), -- meaning that entirety of Haven is vulnerable from the Arcade so it is relatively close to Clockworks proper, rather than Cradle's crust plates. The Arcade and the rest of the town are separated by a series of sluice-like gates. The cavern housing the Arcade is reinforced with metal.

While this a different topic, the fact of all rotating through the Arcade gates pass through the same terminals may suggest that other Arcade-like surface Terminals exist, which have their own sets of depth-fixed Clockwork Terminal. As for the Core Terminal -- [we eventually will discuss it](#core-terminal) later into the analysis, as it differs greatly in its design and purpose.

Haven is surrounded by a brick wall, with a central entrance guarded by a _sliding mechanical gates_, identified by a gear track and a gear itself, seemingly serving as a large vault-like blast-protective door.

Below main entrance to Haven a large chasm with a set of Clockwork tunnels containing [Razwog's power complex facility](#artifact-console-and-a-hatch). We will keep this placement in mind for the analysis of gremlins and [logistics of the Artifact](#chronology-of-the-core-opening-part-1).

##### Guild Hall and Spiral Order Headquarters

On the east side of the town square there are Laboratory and Guild Hall.

Now, considering size of Haven, we suggest that the guild hall canonically contains the Spiral Headquarters, as the building itself seem to be a mechanical, fortified 3-story structure with _ribbed walls_ and _horizontal loopholes_, which here seem to be replaced with windows. Its underground level might be located within a small cavern within the same mountain as the Arcade, with rooms suspended above the Clockworks, as suggetsed by complete layout of Guild Hall.

Reinforced, ribbed walls are designed to enhance structural integrity. A partially upgraded guild hall has at its central section a large table with, supposedly, Skylark equipment, same as one found in the Laboratory in front of the [secondary generator](#skylark). Judging by the room itself, _it seems likely that it is the briefing room of Spiral Order Headquarters_. The [general outline depicted within the Laboratory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Biscotti_Alchemy_Machine.png) above the [food alchemy machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sprite_Food_Alchemy_Machine), considering Laboratory's location, most possibly points to the inner layout of a fully upgraded Guild Hall, as evident by presence of the aforementioned room as well as visible wings of the hall on the map.

##### Haven Laboratory

The Laboratory, while it contains an on-site Isoran research facility, seems also to have an underground level. We make such guess based on 2 elements:

- An unlit pit below the secondary Skylark reactor and an empty space around and below the room where Artifact was held
- The mechanical, Clockwork tunnels-like design and the events of [A New Threat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby) -- `we're starting to get an alarming number of reports of gremlins mobilizing in the Clockworks below Haven` - [A New Threat - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby), -- suggest that the lower layers of the Laboratory are directly connected to Clockwork tunnels similar to _breached floors of Resque Camp_.
- Haven has a location of exposed metal-plated floor similar to the Rescue Camp. The latter case has a direct exposed pit, while in Haven the place being the forge with Vise and Punch located there. Considering the earlier argument of a direct connection to Clockwork tunnels, due to this pattern, such proposal seems to us as particularly plausible.

##### Culture of Strangers

On the west side of Haven bazaar is located. Considering how small the town is, and how geographically isolated it is between a mountain and a chasm, yet accessible from the Clockworks, we suggest that there are likely another -- similar to Haven, -- trade-orinted towns, with a population of Strangers built around Arcade-like Clockwork Terminals with _access to the mines_ in an established network of trading routes.

The trading aspect can be inspected closer - that is the design behind Strangers and their culture.

First of, they seem to live in an lush warm area near the mountain range. The town, apart from the town square is decorated with canopy of designed with patterns fabric cloths hung between of near buildings' walls. The material from which houses are built, are more ofter white, simplistic, occasionally spiral, stoneworks and masonry, or Clockwork metalwork, seemingly used in more secured areas, such as the Lab or auction house on the town square. Buildings are usually not higher than 2 stories, with a few sparsely placed water pools.

Then there are Strangers' designs of tall figures, obscured by _long-sleeved decorated with patterns cloaks_ and _brimmed hats with asymmetric masks_. Strangers usually have an a backpack equipped, protected from the environment as judged by the cloth placed on top of it.

To make accent on masks, gremlins [Punch](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Punch) and [Vise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vise), also possess masks of this similar asymmetric design with one eye being a horizontal slit, although not glowing as the other eye of Strangers' helms.

This makes us think of a region with a warm, possibly dry climate, and, while not explicitly, _a nomadic, resourceful culture_. This may be a fitting design, as for the location of Haven -- it is surrounded by large clusters of revealed Clockworks.

We can suggest that Cradle at that point in time is still being built, although there is an instance of revealed to the surface Clockwork depths being a location of [planetary defenses](#cradle-defenses), we will keep it in mind, as it was the reason behind Skylark crash landing.

Nomadic lifestyle of Stranger can be attributed to a risk of Cradle incorporating more matter to its surface, so this might lead to nearby population centers to embark through arcade and underlying Clockwork tunnels to a different location or mining operations. Those inspirations might have been considered, due to disclosed inspiration behind Haven: `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right` ([10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773)).

Outside of Haven there is a [graveyard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen), which contains the first instance of Lost Souls. This graveyard differs drastically from the rest of graveyards, as it is characterized by a field fo revered arms, a military funeral, _most likely attributed to Spiral Order_. Yet, the fact lost souls to persist there, we link to the [same phenomenon as Isorans of the Iron Hulk during Ghost in The Machine danger mission](#ghosts-in-the-machine).

During the events of [Breaking in the Recruits](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_In_the_Recruits) the Collector fight happens at a location similar to Haven town square. Collector's arena is a distinct city square with a building at its north _featuring armaments within, nearly identical to the auction house_ -- suggesting this being town's center, as auction house and a community center as central to city's plan.

##### Minerals and Souls: Part 2 - Strangers' Mining Operations, Crystal and Mist Energy

Strangers are known to perform mining operations in proximity of Haven, evident by [Greave's outfit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greave) and roster of items, particularly:

- `A sturdy, old helmet once used to dig for precious minerals. It offers a little more defense than a Spiral Helm` ([Mining Hat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mining_Hat)).
- `A strange helm with a single, focused eye favored by junior gunners` ([Cyclop's Cap](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cyclops_Cap)).
- `A sturdy shovel modified to dole out a little extra damage to slime family monsters` ([Slime Slasher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Slasher)).
- `It was suggested that this brutally sharp mining pick could probably be used to hunt both beasts AND minerals. The Clockworks were never the same` ([Big Beast Basher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Big_Beast_Basher)).

Given mine railing in the Arcade, as well as a few storages of minerals, including mineral pillars, we can assume that Strangers were performing mining operations near the Arcade. The same containers, as ones seen near minerals, are carrier across Haven by, now, knights of Spiral Order.

In this context of exploration done by Strangers, we believe, lockdown maps are to be attributed to those areas. Most of those maps have regular Clockwork designs, implying their position below the ground in a similar manner to Guild Hall and Laboratory being located within the mountain and below it. While we won't list all of those maps, as those are redundant, several instances expand on earlier established concepts:

- There are `Mines`, which incorporate stoney surface landscape above Clockwork walls in similar design to the Arcade, implying its position as a cavern.
- The `Reactor` and `Facility` have Clockwork tunnels' designs, but given its name, and position as an arena, we can assume that this is Haven's energy production plant.
- The `Furnace` serves the same function as Clockworks' `Blast Furnaces`, with a difference of the lockdown map having a burning cavern underneath it. The appearance of the cavern is identical to one of Firestorm Citadel. But, given the context, we a leaning to the idea of this place related to Strangers' mining operations, specifically for smelting.
- `Rampants`, while unrelated to Haven, further expand on the Scarlet Fortress's design.

As for the mining material themselves, we can suggest them being the minerals, potentially connecting to reasons for a presence of the devilites of the coliseum, including _king Krogmo as most reminiscent of a devilite in his anatomy_.

Another suggestion, which further ties with the nature of energy, mentioned this time on the wiki, states: `The Clockworks and most every machine the knights encounter run on energy, including their own power armor. All knight armor is equipped with a device that is able to constantly pull energy from the air; known as ‘mist,’ into their armor, allowing them to function and power up machinery they encounter. However, mist dissipates almost as quickly as it is acquired, and thus a knight’s mist energy can never be permanently stored. However, the Strangers that run Haven have long been mining various parts of the Clockworks for pure, crystallized energy and like everything in their possession, it is for sale. This crystallized energy is much more stable and can last forever in a knights reserve tank, inside their armor ... Due to the intense power source at Cradle's core, the entire planet's atmosphere is imbued with loose, airborne mist energy ... Each Spiral Knight will constantly absorb this mist energy ... The Strangers operate an elaborate mining system in order to retrieve and harness the crystallized energy that occurs at great depths, beneath the planet's crust` ([Crystal Energy - Lore - Cory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Energy&oldid=20)).

Yet, we don't possess the evidence that minerals, despite them containing energy, to be equal as a medium to Crystal Energy or Fire Crystals: `We need to analyze how mineral power affects the Core. The problem is that very little power reaches down to these depths. We can gather so much data from each gate as it launches`, as specified by the technician left of Vaelyn at the Core Terminal. As at a current point only minerals are seen to be transported across Haven, and if we commit to this representation of Haven mining operations, we would identify _minerals as containers for crystal energy_, hence arriving to the initial idea of an underlying type of energy which permeates those mediums.

At that, the description of `Due to the intense power source at Cradle's core, the entire planet's atmosphere is imbued with loose, airborne mist energy` is very similar to one of [Static Clinger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Clinger): `A latent strand of energy that floats throughout the Clockworks, frequently catching onto hair and clothing. It's too large to properly distill into Energy, but it's very useful in alchemy`. Given those factors, we propose, the glowing energy symbol found across Spiral Order armors is the mist energy collector or tank.

Notably, it is through the bribe several [Bombhead Masks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bombhead_Mask): `A mask commissioned by King Krogmo to celebrate the launch of Blast Network that curiously resembles a live bomb. Available in a wide variety of styles, there is likely one to match any armor set`, can be acquired, including a [Cursed Bombhead Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Cursed_Bombhead_Mask-Equipped.png). Due to its design and _acknowledgement of curse_, it reminds of [undead Bombies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bombie). Could it be that those masks are manufactured in the same manner as zombies are transformed after their death into bombies? As there are devilites present, even if their are not seemingly affiliated with Undercorp, we have to keep in mind their presence.

##### Strangers' Festivals

There are a few celebrations in Haven, attributed to Strangers' culture:

- `The Dark Harvest Festival is now being celebrated in Haven and will end on November 1st! This annual event honors the mischievous Punkin King in order to ensure a healthy fall harvest for Haven. All Clockwork Tunnels-style levels like Power Complexes and Blast Furnaces now have a chance of featuring special rooms inhabited by the Punkin King. Simply hop on the party pad and discover if the Punkin King has candy tokens or something else in store for you!` ([The Dark Harvest Festival](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/66484)) - [Dark harvest](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Dark_Harvest).

  Strangers are aware of such entities as [Phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom) of [Graveyard](#graveyards), [scarabs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarab), and [Pumpkin King](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pumpkin_King), as seen from the masks obtained from [Maskwell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskwell):

  - `A high quality Spookat mask made to celebrate the Dark Harvest Festival. It's very well made and lasts forever!` ([Authentic Spookat Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Spookat_Mask)).
  - `A high quality Frankenzom mask made to celebrate the Dark Harvest Festival. It's very well made and lasts forever! ` ([Authentic Frankenzom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Frankenzom_Mask)).
  - `A high quality Scarab mask made to celebrate the Dark Harvest Festival. It's very well made and lasts forever!` ([Authentic Scarab Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Scarab_Mask)).
  - `A high quality gourdling mask made to celebrate the Dark Harvest Festival. It's very well made and lasts forever!` ([Authentic Gourdling Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Gourdling_Mask)).
  - `A high quality Phantom mask made to celebrate the Dark Harvest Festival. It's very well made and lasts forever!` ([Authentic Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Phantom_Mask)).
  - `A high quality howlitzer mask made to celebrate the Dark Harvest Festival. It's very well made and lasts forever!` ([Authentic Howlitzer Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Howlitzer_Mask)).

  Through those item and their variants made of paper Dark Harvest is characterized as celebration of the supernatural.

  In that regard, Dark Harvest -- both through it acknowledgement by Strangers and festive redecoration of Haven, -- becomes an important celebration within Strangers' culture on Cradle, **acknowledging the supernatural to far greater extent that Isorans**, _as the latter are distinctly unfamiliar with the supernatural_.

- `The Strangers pause at the equinox to recognize the brief moment of cosmic balance on Cradle. For just a breath of time, there is harmony between night and day, the sun and moon, and symmetry in the celestial sphere` ([Balance of the Equinox](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178), [Cradle Equinox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box)).
- Not particularly and event, but a tendency of [Shroud of the Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea) resurging over Cradle.

Earlier we have discussed meaning of several [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box) items, and how they are unique in 2 attributes: they are from Isoran past, and how alchemical meaning is weaved into them. Strangers being capable of recognizing this property would mean that in their own culture relatively similar cosmological and mythological concepts exist.

#### Analysis of Apocrean Realm

Apocrea represents the prime instance of an eldritch deity within the established comsology.

Due to this, we have to analyze metaphysical nature of Apocrean Realm from 2 major perspectives:

- From an in-universe cosmology, based on the established concepts of minerals, energy, and souls, and how they coincide with Apocrea's motivation, one which was [initially presented through Danford](#apocreas-goal-as-negation-of-existence) as a desire of reversion of existence into `primordial blackness`;
- Secondly, from the understanding of Apocrean Realm having significant part of its thematic foundation in Lovecraftian mythology as a thought framework.

##### Yog-Sothothery and Myths

As we will discuss Apocrean Realm from both of those approaches, we inevitably arrive to an idea of __Lovecraft's Yog-Sothothery__ _-- a totality of themes, figures, motifs, narrative and physical principles, and a pantheon of gods, as they are defined by Lovecraft_. Those gods do may be seen as defying physical laws, but, for this analysis we will approach them as representative of Lovecraft's universe physics to its farthest extent.

Within Yog-Sothothery, both in rituals and physical laws coexist within a single cosmology, as we have earlier noted on that in relation to [devilite ritual circles as emergent from Apocrean Realm](#apocrean-ritual-circles).

But, as established this system is, as in Yog-Sothothery, as in Apocrean Realm, Underworld, and as we will see later, the Swarm, -- while all operate within their own corresponding Universes, _the precise details, laws, and specificities are left ambiguous as not primarily important to the narrative_. They are intentionally left undefined and may contradict, where the __true scope of underlying physical laws is meant to be unknowable__.

As stated in the very beginning, we are planning to analyze those details to their conclsusions and the physical laws of Spiral Knights universe.

Cradle has a connection to the Underworld, in, at least, 2 instances:

1. First, there were tortomega, who stumbled upon Undercorp as the latter entered material realm, explored in [Arrival of Undercorp](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp),
2. Second, there are gremlins, who are reported to outsource development of projects against Spiral Knights: `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` ([Work for Idle Hands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands)).

Apocrean Realm, on the other hand, remains unexplored.

At that, [Professor Allister Danford's journal](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276) is the largest source of information of the entities which inhabit Apocrean Realm -- Apocrea, -- its motivations and goals: `In the deep dark below, beyond the space where time wakens and yawns, beyond the shadows cast by the great leviathan of eternity, the Apocrea stir. Within cities where geometry and madness share meaning, constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. Oh such beautiful souls! Bright and vibrant like fruit warming on the branch from a summer’s sun, longing for the pull of the earth below, the chance to seed and grow and birth anew. What terrible naivety! What utter farce! All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! Though they may steal sanctuary in the cracks and corners of their terrible realm, it is ever fleeting. The blinding gaze of the Apocrea is boundless. The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black. Dear heavens! The stars grin down with lustful intent! It is an abomination, an embodiment of sublime beauty, dark and blooded! I weep and laugh before the shroud that waits! Nuul-duggath, I am seared in your gaze oh Apocrea, teeming filth of ages! Nyarrlotth-MORG! (The remaining pages are a series of indecipherable symbols and patterns, seemingly drawn with great haste)` ([Recovered from the journal of Prof. Allister Danford, Dean of Antiquities - Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

`The Apocrea are ... a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life ... The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap. In these traps they stalk any life, harvesting their souls for some unimaginable purpose` ([Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus)).

As there are souls to be freed across the [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau), which are kept seal by [Apocrean Sigils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Sigil#Apocrean_Sigil): `An otherworldly brand placed upon a soul claimed by the mysterious Apocrea. Removing it allows the captured soul to escape imprisonment within the terrible realm of the Apocrea`, we will draw an initial parallel to everfrost's capacity to contain souls.

Grasping Plateau itself mey be partially inspired by [Plateau of Leng](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Plateau_of_Leng). During the exploration of Plateau of Leng, there is a hooded figure:

<BookCitation source="The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath - H.P.Lovecraft">

  the remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the High-Priest not to be described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the Other Gods

  ...

  Then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyish-white paws, and Carter knew what the noisome high-priest was. And in that hideous second stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have dared to attempt, for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne. He knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold table-land outside

</BookCitation>

Apocrean Harvester, given its stature and presence across the Plateau present not with structures of other civilizations of atemple, but a graveyard, we suggest to likely be of that inspiration.

More so, Plateau of Leng is supposedly located at a crossing point of multiple dimensions while itself being seen both in the material realm of Earth (`In The Mountains of Madness`), but also in the Dreamlands (`The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath`), which is not an exact, but similar theme to Grasping Plateau being a trap, -- emphasized by its aggressive name as explicitly `Grasping`, alluding to power of the Harvester, -- located in proximity of material realm by its nature as a trap, within an the area of influence of the Apocrea through presence of the Shroud.

As those notions are rooted in lovecraftian horror thematically, Danford's text are in this genre are, most confidently, _reveal truth despite being delivered through a len of an unreliable narrator, a madman_, -- a characteritic element of the modern interpretations of the genre past Lovecraft and his peers, which at a current point may be considered a trope on its own from a perspective of pop-cultural adoption, refraction and evolution of the genre.

The idea of capturing souls is one of central elements to Apocrea's motivation, but, to asess further details on operational metaphysical principals of the realm, we have to cover its other elements.

Allister Danford in the context of eldritch horror may represent a similar character -- [Danforth](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Danforth) of [`In the Mountains Of Madness`](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness). It is also worth noting that Apocrean activity, as eldritch entity, __manifests as insomnia__, as stated per memorandum: `We at Spiral HQ are concerned about a spike in the number of knights who push themselves to the limit with lack of sleep, and Medical has noted a similar uptick in knights who want to sleep, but can't. We suspect this is at least partly due to recent Apocrean activity in the Clockworks` ([Sleep is for the Strong](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111472)).

##### Apocrea's Goal Of Negation Of existence: Part 2

<!--may be compared to otehr wolrd-ending nihilistic threats in ch11, here we define it-->

Apocrea, semantically, may be derivation of a term _Apocrypha_, referring to _texts, which exist outside of Biblican canon_. This connection allows for 2 sides of an emerging narrative to be outlined:

1. As an eldritch deity, it may fall outside of the defined cosmology as an entity superseeding it. Such interpretation may not coincide with a perspective defined in Yog-Sothothery, as those deities exist within a finite system of principles and laws, but, more modern interpretations may to some degree adopt a previously noted capacity to redefine reality with its presence.
2. A connection to Biblical lore was initially found in relation to heavenly kingdom of Valkyries. Herein this notion deepens as then we can interpret existence of eldritch deities as either:

  - Supernaturally wrong, an _entity that was not meant to exist_, or;
  - An _antagonistic entity opposed_ to an unknown actor, power or principle.

As far as current analysis allows, we can identify the _opposition_ principle as __onе of diversity of any form of life or unlife set in looming threat of total negation of existence__ through [earlier noted concept](#apocreas-goal-of-negation-of-existence-part-1) behind Danford's quote `all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` ([Recovered from the journal of Prof. Allister Danford, Dean of Antiquities - Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

Yet, as we noted at point 2, there is a possibility of a divine actor opposed to Apocrea framed within a earlier narrative of a lasting conflict for existence. We propose such character behind [Echo Stones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone), as representative of that power through characteristic of the Swarm within a cohesive narrative of all four Echo Stones -- a different entity in its goals, yet it retains its existential danger -- without, as we believe, a requirement to consider Swarm's nature but only _its symbolic role_ through the quote: `YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone#Echo_Stone)). The Night in Echo Stones' context may be considered as one of Swarm's presence.

To address the first subpoint of Apocrea as an entity not meant to exist, while keeping awareness of the Swarm now in context of Apoacrea's analysis, the supernatural wrongness of the being may be, we suggest, attributed to greater extent instead to the Swarm because of its texual and visual represenataion, in particular, as pixalated fog. It is a phenomenon, which may be seen as artifical, both through fog's shape and 2-dimensional nature compared to environment of the Core.

In that regard, the wrongness may be further identified within character of the Swarm as per quote: `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel). A `creation unlike all` is a term, which, given context of an entity behind Echo Stones and both symbolic and phsyical environment of the __Sanctuary__, a sacred place, can be seen as alien also according to Echo Stones author's expansive understanding of reality, even if hyperbolized.

If we were to compare Swarm' and Apocrea's _wrong_ nature, we suggest, we will observe 2 distinctly different types of characteristic:

- For Apocrea it is its _alien nature as an eldritch being_, which, whether physical laws of this universe alow it, remains part of them and had to operate under their logic, as it creates elaborate traps within the material realm, hence retianing its remote nature as a separate realm. This is achieved predominantly by the narrative constant of lovecraftian narrative of inability for a human mind to completely and totaly understand the complexity of eldritch-encompassing reality.
- While we are not aware of the specifics of Swarm's physiology nor whether it breaks predefined metaphysics -- whether it ever _could exist_, -- Swarm's nature so far is defined as an entity which was _not meant to exist_.

At that, we can identify Apocrea as a malevolent eldritch deity from the perspective of current complexity of existence. Apocrea's goal is one of annihilation or regression of that complexity to its initial, `primordial` state of being.

It is a specifc interpretation of a personafied force of death within a framework of classical mythology, wherein gods are representative of processes of the world and explanations for those cyclical processes.

Within this narrative _Apocrea becomes god of death, which denies natural cycle of life_ -- __it does not maintain order or balance, it is a one-directional purposed annihilation of existence__. It is a figure respresentative of an End-of-the-World narrative, where after reaching the state of `primordial blackness` the potential __cyclical rebirth of existence of classical mythology is denied__, as suggested by the acknowledgement of this natural order: `Oh such beautiful souls! Bright and vibrant like fruit warming on the branch from a summer’s sun, longing for the pull of the earth below, the chance to seed and grow and birth anew. What terrible naivety! What utter farce! All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe!`.

Eldritch deities of Yog-Sothothery nor works beyond it do not define their goals as equal to negation of existence, but usually operate on their own, often unknowable to human conciousness, principles, which may be only perceived as negative or lackig from human perspective. This ambiguity of nuanced motivation, we suggest, is absent due to Danford's elaborate explanation coinciding with focus on harvest of souls from accounts of lot souls found across the Obsidian Nexus.

But, it order to further identify Apocrea's effects on physical effects, we should eventually cover nature of the [Void](#the-void-part-1) and its possible relation to `primordial blackness`, as there are a few particularly similar concepts found across other metaphysical systems worth investigating in [due time](#the-void-part-2-massa-confusa):

- _Wu Chi of Taoist_
- _Chaos of Greek mythology_
- _Ginnungagap of Norse mythology_
- _Sunyata of Buddhism_
- Alchemical Void

##### Apocrean Materials

There are 2 elements to Apocrea which not only allow it to expand its identity, but to furher relate to lovecraftian mythology:

- Description of environments across Apocrean Realm
- Descriptions of agents of Apocrea within material realm

There are more items which expand on Apocrean lore and its environment:

- `An otherworldly brand placed upon a soul claimed by the mysterious Apocrea. Removing it allows the captured soul to escape imprisonment within the terrible realm of the Apocrea` ([Apocrean Sigil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Sigil#Apocrean_Sigil)).

    With the context of those souls being trapped by ritual circle-like structures within Grasping Plateau, we suggest this is hte next element of souls' entrappment, which restricts their capabilities.

- `A jet-black shard of unnatural stone. Holding it fills your head with imagery of a distant shore where waves crash against rocks that seem to writhe in the chill of the water` ([Obsidian Shard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Shard)). A 3-star material.

    The characteristic of this obsidian being jet-black was called out in the introduction of Underworld, specifically, [trojan horseshoes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe): `A jet black horseshoe. It appears relatively harmless`.

- `A strange, vile reagent thought to be harnessed by the Apocrea to build their structures. Once it gets on your skin it seems to never wash off. No, it must, you simply need to scrub harder. Harder, yes...` ([Binding Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Binding_Essence)). A 4-star material.
- `A rare metal recovered from a shattered mountain deep within the realm of the Apocrea. Under a microscope it reveals to have a kind of impossible geometry. Perhaps more dedicated study, free from the distractions of the world would reveal its secrets` ([Perplexing Element](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perplexing_Element)). A 5-star material.

The `distant shore where waves crash against rocks` and `rare metal recovered from a shattered mountain` refer to Apocrean Realm as one if not associated with water and oceans, but a location, where both mountains and oceans exist in regular understanding of those terms.

The proximity to an ocean seems intentional as it was important enough to be reflected in material's description. The cities themselves may be built by Apocrea, if we extrapolate the quote `reagent thought to be harnessed by the Apocrea to build their structures` ([Binding Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Binding_Essence)), but, the structures may include only obsidian obelisks, rather than cities themselves: `within cities where geometry and madness share meaning, constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being` (Danford), while Danford states only that dark machines are built and dreamt.

Presence of cities creates impression of an advanced realm with an established civilizaion.

###### City of Sarkomand, Dreamlands

With those themes we can suggest Northern Dreamlands in proximity of Leng and Sarkomand of Yog-Sothothery to be a prototype for this landscape.

Sarkomand in particular, due to its remoteness and alien nature, while is a coincidence, may evoke a similar tone to Apocrean Realm with inclusion of descriptions of the environment:

<BookCitation source="The Dream-Quaet of Unknown Kadath - H.P.Lovecraft">

  And in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the almost-humans; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves, and wondrous with high fanes and carven palaces. Great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six sphinx-crowned gates to a vast central plaza, and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase.

  ...

  Indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied Sarkomand, whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the first true human saw the light, and whose twin titan lions guard eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the Great Abyss.

  ...

  Ahead stretched double rows of pillars, and the fragments and pedestals of pillars, that spoke of a broad and bygone street; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens. Far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza, and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things. Huge winged lions of diarite they were, with blackness and shadow between them. Full twenty feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads, and snarled derisive on the ruins around them. And Carter knew right well what they must be, for legends tells of only one such twain. They were the changeless guardians of the Great Abyss, and these dark ruins were in truth primordial Sarkomand.

</BookCitation>

###### City of Carcossa, The King in Yellow

Other than this, presence of tombstones across the Grasping Plateau being a graveyard, reminds us _Robert Chamber's_ `Inhabitant Of Carcossa`. A diffent realm, one described in `Cassilda's Song`, where the concept of a remote location, -- a distant city of Carcosa in `The King in Yellow`, -- is described as follows:

<BookCitation source="Robert Chambers - The King in Yellow - The Mask">

  Along the shore the cloud waves break,

  The twin suns sink behind the lake,

  The shadows lengthen

  In Carcosa.

  Strange is the night where black stars rise,

  And strange moons circle through the skies

  But stranger still is

  Lost Carcosa.

  Songs that the Hyades shall sing,

  Where flap the tatters of the King,

  Must die unheard in

  Dim Carcosa.

  Song of my soul, my voice is dead;

  Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed

  Shall dry and die in

  Lost Carcosa.

</BookCitation>

The inital quote of `Along the shore the cloud waves break` is interesting to us as it establishes a similar relation to water, but devoid of city's own architecture, compared to Sarkomand of Dreamlads and Cities of Apocrean Realm, yet, as all three share a connection to water, we wonder whether its symbolic interpretation, such as surfacinfr rom depths of the unknown, may provice a hint to understanding Apocrean Realm as it is relevant for Carcossa or city of Sarkomand.

###### Onyx Castle of Kadath, Dreamlands

In relation to metals -- Perplexing Element, `A rare metal recovered from a shattered mountain deep within the realm of the Apocrea. Under a microscope it reveals to have a kind of impossible geometry`, -- it was recovered from a shattered mountain makes us think of _great onyx canyons on the north of Dreamlands_.

Onyx was used as primary building material for civilization of Inganok and a castle for Elder Gods at the top a mountain Kadath, as revealed by the events of [`The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath`](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dream-Quest_of_Unknown_Kadath).

We suggest that Apocrean Relam may have been inspired by Kadath, given its greater importance to the narrative, direct relation to gods, and focus on a concrete mineral, therein being onyx and for Apocrean Realm -- obsidian.

<BookCitation source="The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath - H.P.Lovecraft">

  So close was the great black mountain that its sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward, and in the darkness they could discern nothing upon it. Vaster and vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above, and Carter could see that it was well-nigh blasphemous in its immensity. Well might its stones have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the rock in the hill pass north of Inganok, for such was its size that a man on its threshold stood even as an ant on the steps of earth’s loftiest fortress. The pshent of unknown stars above the myriad domed turrets glowed with a sallow, sickly flare, so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx.

  ...

  All was night in the titan courtyard, and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched portal engulfed the column. Vortices of cold wind surged dankly through sightless labyrinths of onyx, and Carter could never tell what Cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his endless aërial twisting.

</BookCitation>

The chaotic architecture of the surrounding Obsidian Nexus landscape further suggests a duality of the environment, as if the proper chambers of the Nexus were _built among the obsidian peaks_, from obsidian, which at some point, given description of [Obsidian Shard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Shard) -- `A jet-black shard of unnatural stone. Holding it fills your head with imagery of a distant shore where waves crash against rocks that seem to writhe in the chill of the water`, -- _should reach a coastal line_.

The environment of the Departure is opposite to alien nature of Obsidian Nexus -- being replaced with alien architecture identified by _polished slabs_, _angular structures_, _floating obelisks_, and _streams of purple glowing matter_, which we intially identified as [Apocrean Ritual Circles](#apocrean-ritual-circles), herein __being reminiscent__ of [Amu-Sol's pale writings in, presumably, everfrost](#writings-of-amu-sol).

Because of similar application and appearance of a purple mineral similar to instances across Amu-Sol, despite floating nature of the prior mineral both across puzzles of Grasping Plateau and pillars of the _ziggurat-like structure behind_ [Obelisks of Creation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obelisk_of_Creation), we stand on interpretation of this mineral as Dark Matter, which itself is used during transmutation of [Obsidian Equipment](#obsidian-equipment), such as [Obsidian Edge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Edge).

##### Obsidian Equipment

There are weapons are acquired both from the [Obelisk of Creation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obelisk_of_Creation) and the Mysterious Alchemy Station:

- `A sinister sword made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. Simply holding it makes you somehow feel guilty of an unknown crime` ([Obsidian Edge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Edge)).
- `A deadly gun made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. With every shot fired, a faint whisper is heard, believed to be the true name of its target` ([Obsidian Carbine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Carbine)).
- `A peculiar bomb made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. Despite it being a bomb, some are drawn to holding it and 'solving' it as if it were some kind of puzzle` ([Obsidian Crusher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Crusher)). The idea of it being solved reminds the Lament Configuration puzzle box from Hellraiser franchise. There, the Lament Configuration is a portal to a different dimension.

From those 3 items, their design and behavior, we can derive following ideas:

- Obelisks are capable of being repurposed into equipment, their functon weaponized -- a direction found for graviton technology in prior case of deveilites
- Given emergence of tendrils during weapons' charge attacks, entities of Apocrean Realm are summoned through utilization of weapons and, potentially, power of obelisks, as those comprise the functioning and essetial part of those weapons.

As all of weapons are repurposed [obsidian obelisks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Furniture). All of obelisks have an identical description: `A jet-black stele of unnatural stone from the realm of the Apocrea. As you gaze upon it, the stone seems to writhe and pulse with an eternal energy that is simultaneously alluring and sinister in a most grotesque manner`. Obelisks are referred to be made of obsidian, which is called here as `unnatural stone` -- same as [Obsidian Shard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Shard): `A jet-black shard of unnatural stone. Holding it fills your head with imagery of a distant shore where waves crash against rocks that seem to writhe in the chill of the water`. This means, either:

- Obsidian is a mineral in its nature related and found in Apocrean Realm
- Obsidian itself is what unnatural stone resembles the most as the closest mineral from the material realm to depict the unnatural. It is not obsidian of material realm, but a mineral most similar to it.

###### Unnatural Stone of Apocrean Realm

As onyx was the primary material in construction of Kadath castle, we would suggest that obsidian is the mineral which is favoured by Apocrea. This would mean abundance of obsidian or other mineral across Apocrean Realm.

On the contrary, even given accent on different minerals and jewels of several prize boxes, the eldritch -- unknowable and ambigious, -- nature of obsidian, which frames it with an unresolvable vagueness, it would be a soild argument to identify a different mineral as the unnatural stone, rather than obsidian itself.

As minerals are associated with cosmic forces, as dragons' species embody universal aspects, as wisps, as representaions of abstract will and share aspect of progress and consciousness, -- the thread of __spiritually symbolic value becoming a cosmic constant__ seems to us as a reasonable argument to assume that unnatural stone is obsidian because of obsidian's inherent to this universe symbolic, particularly eldritch, quality.

##### Origin of Graviton Technology

Obsidian Crusher specifically is reminiscent in its function to Graviton Bomb. Graviton Bomb itself is both a requirement for Crusher's transmutaion and a weaponized by Underworld grim gates' portal.

This would mean that graviton technology and Underworld are linked to Apocrean Realm. The portal technology, similar to ritual circles could have emerged from Apocrean Realm as they entered Underworld, granting this technology to devilites.


And, as apocrean portals allow to enter Apocrean Realm from material realm, for Devilites transition between Underworld and material realm is possible, as well as across the material relam through grim gates, we suggest that this principle ma allow to reach other realms. Furthermore, manifestation of portions of Apocrean Realm, as at Haven Town Squre, we would conclude, renders Apocrea as most skilled actor capable of transitioning over separate realms. Whether

The distinction between explosive emblem of evil eye symbol of Graviton Bomb and 3-dot pattern of Obsidian Crusher may hint at the target dimension, to which a connection is established -- this is a speculation, but one we will examine further, including instances of 3-dot patterns and their symbolism.

As far as Obsidian Crusher and context of Apocrean Realm allows, Crusher's 3-dot pattern, we propose, is meant to _represent Harvester's or Apocrea's face of 3 glowing eyes_.

Apart from those notions, we observe presence of purple energy, permiating obsidian weapons as well as through the broken floors of obsidian across Nexus-adjacent locations. The latter is most distinctly seen in Haven Town Square, where _obsidian obelisk emerges from the ground with the corresponding lines of purple light_.

##### Eternal Energy, Obsidian and Minerals

Obelisks refer to an `eternal energy` within their descriptions: `A jet-black stele of unnatural stone from the realm of the Apocrea. As you gaze upon it, the stone seems to writhe and pulse with an eternal energy that is simultaneously alluring and sinister in a most grotesque manner` ([Obsidian Obelisks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Furniture)). Due to lack of any other references to a specific type of energy, we propose that this exact eternal energy is one observed in the aforementioned gear as _a purple glowing stream_.

The same `eternal energy` would become one identical to instances of glowing within the Apocrean Realm from below the floors. Within the Nexus there are 2 more instances of the floors missing, revealing presence of purple space:

- One of an obelisk seemingly [emerging from the ground](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Shroud_of_the_Apocrea-Obsidian_Nexus_2.png);
- A [portal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Shroud_of_the_Apocrea-Obsidian_Nexus.png) at the end of the Nexus, located above the elevator. As lines of energy extend or concentrate upon the portal.

As light is most cases is emanating under the broken floor brickwork, we can assume that the source of this energy is the supposed Apocrean Realm proper, located both physically and metaphysically below the Nexus, if we assume that the visited locations are not located specifically within the Apocrean Realm itself, but within a Shroud, as a transient state between the realms.

Those safeguards, given context of the Shroud, may lead to the Shroud partially incorporating elements of the material realm where it had appeared, being the Clockworks elevator due to an initial entrance from Clockworks, and, potentially, Grasping Plateau. For the case of Grasping Plateau its unique configuration was earlier a point for us suggesting a connection with Carcossa, but as far as over analysys allows, depending on supernaturality of this depth's origin, it would exist in other form, other than one mimicking or [incorporating Almirian architecture](#almirian-architecture).

In relation to the nature of obsidian, the [Apocrean Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Crown) from the roster of [Obsidian Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Prize_Box) is positioned here as one of other _jewel crowns_. But it is not referred as made of obsidian, compared to the [rest of crowns](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Crown#Apocrean_Crown), but rather Apocrean.

The meaning of those crowns remains unknown so far, but, as they are constructed from suspended gemstone, we would assume they are powered by the same principle as the mineral pillars across Clockworks, and in that regard obsidian obelisks, potentially being close in nature to base 5 minerals, relate to underlying principle of energy.

With this, to an established landscape of Apocrean Realm we add a concept of a native to it `eternal energy`, which when observed, is colored purple. This energy might be one aloowing for suspention in the air of earlier proposed [Apocrean ritual circles](#apocrean-ritual-circles) in an unknwon -- ethereal, -- state, which allows them to be formed into 3-dimensional structures.

Despite this seeming difference, as we had a _notion of energy in different variants being central to other narratives_, presence of _color purple_ both within finite structure of colored lines and as more abstract presence within the obelisks, we would __identify eternal energy as the universal Energy__. Within this identification, Apocrea's need for souls would be explained by them being a specific -- sentient, -- configuration of tha energy, as a container.

##### Apocrean Engines

If we strip away other context of Danford's speech, the engines are presented as ends for means of collecting souls: `Within cities where geometry and madness share meaning, constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. ... All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! ...  The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black. Dear heavens! The stars grin down with lustful intent! It is an abomination, an embodiment of sublime beauty, dark and blooded! I weep and laugh before the shroud that waits!`.

Apocrea is located within the cities. Here we recall idea of an Apocrean obsidian city being parallel to onyx castle on top of Kadath in the dreamlands -- a dvelling of Great Ones, gods of Earth.

The quote `geometry and madness share meaning` suggests a concept of madness being reflected in an eldritch geometry or topology of Apocrean architecture, which might result in the unexplicable nature of, for example, Perplexing Element. So far we were considering Obsidian Nexus being an instance of the city's architecture, due to its defined design. And through its depiction we have previously arrived to the idea of Kadath. If we follow those parallels further, as well as add up to them concept of `constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse`, we arrive to the idea of cities being manifested by Apocrea's will, as those characterisics follow after the cities, albeit with an ambiguity, one that might be potentially intentional.

This idea of `constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse` contradicts the physical construction process of cities, as suggested by the [Binding Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Binding_Essence): `A strange, vile reagent thought to be harnessed by the Apocrea to build their structures`, unless this process consists of multiple steps of varying physicality.

We are considering the metaphysical, dream-oriented interpretaion as plausibly applicable both to cities and machines. First, we will test an interpretation of `impuse` and `thought` as characteristics of the act of dreaming, as cities had physicality and material explored through Apocrean sigils, and then we will test the grammatically accurate interpretation, wherein cities are ones constructed from thought becouse of ambigious boundary of concepts between geometry and madness of `geometry and madness share meaning`.

Through `Apocrea dream dark machines into being` we can then propose physicality of those machines. `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` states that __souls are the fuel of those machines__, labelling them engines. The act of roaring so far was attributed to engines specifically, rather than souls, so we can conclude that its is those engines are being heard as `screaming across distant stars`, which would establish their physical presence.

Role of a metaphorical void, a negation of existence, also emerges here in reference to engines' volume:

- `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).
- `The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their [Apocrea's] dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black. Dear heavens! The stars grin down with lustful intent! It is an abomination, an embodiment of sublime beauty, dark and blooded! I weep and laugh before the shroud that waits!` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

As Apocrean Realm was manifestated in the Town Square, it is unlikely that the primordial black was observed at that point. Nor its name suggests it possessing color, so the eternal energy remains linked to the specifically Apocrean Realm, as one of the components to its nature.

Then, what is the purpose of the engines? If we reconsider `The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their [Apocrea's] dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)), then the engines provide the means to bring reality into the primordial black.

We can further suggest their importance due to being a single defined goal of collecting souls in the first place. _This motive as one seemingly kept in secrecy_, as it is further hinted by a Lost Soul within the Nexus: `a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life. ... The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap. In these traps they stalk any life, harvesting their souls for some unimaginable purpose` ([Shroud of Apocrea - Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Nexus)).

This leads us to the idea of roaring death of the world -- `'Speak with the one, true voice and they will listen. Quiet as a child's whisper, roaring like the death of this world'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Influence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Influence#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Influence)), -- as one attribued to the engines, as the voice of those `screaming` and `roaring` engines is one of Apocrea, and a method of influencing reality in a detrimental, destructive manner.

In order to fuel those engines, Shroud is opened to lure or capture souls, as living beings with auras.

If we return to initial reasoning of this interpretation, as acts of impulse and thought are attributed to dreaming, then, as now dream may create reality, they would be capable of manifesting Apocrean cities, if not reality of that realm found through sigil-transmuted materials. In prior case the final result of reality being dreamt, would remain, as then we can interpret the quote `geometry and madness share meaning` differently, as cities being thought -- _a cognitive act reflected in reality_, -- suggesting a removal of aforementioned boundary between physicality and concept, hence resulting in the same case of matter being created or supernaturally arranged by act of dreaming, as context of the passasge on the engines can exist separately: `... the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars`.

It is unknown, whether Nefarious Imp is involved into the communication, given their armor's design resembling Apocrean disciples'.

##### Apocrean Disciples

Then there are cultists or the disciples. They are separated into groups, characterized by a single property found in their respective titles.

###### Obsidian Mantle of Sight

`Through my eyes you will see the path to ages. Pure is my gaze, free from the lies of reality'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Sight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight)).

We assume that the hood, which disciples wear both in application and design is meant to represent Apocrea's eyes given the identical design, -- three dot-like eyes in a triaglular pattern, -- to Harvester's face and accent on sight as motif.

There are [scarabs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarab), which also have a similar eye pattarn and are undead, -- this might be a coincidense or a more complex case of Apocrean, _insect-like_ lifeforms adapting to Underworld through using skeletal rib-cage as a shell, given their design.

With this, the aforementioned three-dot pattern of Obsidian Crusher's explosion is a plausible depiction of Apocrea's eyes, assuming a simlar to Harvester eldritch physiology as native to Apocrean Realm.

It is also here a narrative of false reality is established -- false or deceiving, through which Apocrea's eyes or gaze allows to see through.

In terms of strictly lovecraftian narrative, it would be true, as eldritch beings possess a magnitudes more expansive understanding of reality.

This would not characterize perceived reality as explicitly malevelent, but it will offer a different perspective on Apocrea's vision from cultists' perspective, even considering its goal of negation of existence.

###### Obsidian Mantle of Rituals

`'With great practice and tender care, with an eternal heart and mind so pure: sharpen the stone, sturdy the chain, welcome the night, drink the cup of kings'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Rituals#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Rituals)).

As the name of the mantle contains a term "ritual", we can assume that the process of:

- `sharpening the stone`
- `sturdying the chain`
- `welcoming of the night`
- `drinking the cup of kings`

Is the description of said ritual. There is a high probability of metaphors beign present. We will return to this ritual later.

The `eternal heart and mind so pure` relates to a prerequisite of one to perform the ritual. The idea of purity was mentioned above in `Pure is my gaze, free from the lies of reality'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Sight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight)), which may identify one performing the ritual as already under Apocrea's influence.

An eternal heart, we assume, is immortality. Other than that, we are reminded of depths' names of [The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion): `Poisoned Minds` and `Cold Hearts`. This is also a motif of minds and hearts we have to keep track of in case of familiar themes to be discovered later. Among Apocrean cultists a sacred ritual is established.

###### Obsidian Mantle of Influence

`'Speak with the one, true voice and they will listen. Quiet as a child's whisper, roaring like the death of this world'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Influence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Influence#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Influence)).

Starting from the end, we need to cover the apocrean engines: `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness ... All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! Though they may steal sanctuary in the cracks and corners of their terrible realm, it is ever fleeting. The blinding gaze of the Apocrea is boundless. The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black. ... I weep and laugh before the shroud that waits!` ([Recovered from the journal of Prof. Allister Danford, Dean of Antiquities - Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

At [apocrean engines](#apocrean-engines) we have identified the `roaring like the death of this world` as the roar of engines Danford describes, which are fueled by captured souls. Those engines are ones to be heard across material realm and are the means to return the world to its initial state. The phrase `dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black` defines Apocrea's goal from Danford's perspective as such.

The `quiet as a child's whisper`, while we do not have any relations to chldren yet, there might be a metaphor for Apocrea's eldritch duality as in description of obelisks: `eternal energy that is simultaneously alluring and sinister in a most grotesque manner` ([Obsidian Obelisks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Furniture)).

<!--This is very important, but, so far, we may connect the roaring death to roaring engines as ones to bring about the end. Now, with introduction of the mantle, we also may conclude that the one true voice is one of Apocrea, which is also heard from the engines due to application of word "roaring."-->

The quote `Speak with the one, true voice and they will listen` may be interpreted in 2 ways:

- It suggests that a reader of those notes will speak with true cosmic voice of Apocrea, as Apocrea was previously referring to the reader as "you," and Apocrea, ones the speaker becomes aware of it, starts to listen. Apocrea will respond in the aforementioned manner.
- The "they", the mantle refers to anyone outside of the cult. Given mantle's name -- `of influence`, -- is may be seen as a method of communion with Apocrea, allowing one to be possessed by Apocrea's goal both mentally and, potentially, physically.

Yet, as Apocrea had referred to itself as `I`:

- `Through my eyes you will see the path to ages. Pure is my gaze, free from the lies of reality'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Sight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Sight))
- `'Wrap thyself in my embrace and succumb to my infinite love. Let your breath drift from you like candle smoke, dreaming deeper and deeper still'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Devotion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Devotion#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Devotion))

We would suggest that among aforementioned interpretations, the latter scenario -- of influencig through Apocrea's voice, -- seems more plausible, as it implies the subject neither reader nor Apocrea, while still referring to the cultist on individual basis. Mantle's influence emerges from bearer's supernatural worship to Apocrea and capacity to speak with Apocrea's voice and likely will. It may be framed as anc of supernatural, eldritch possession.

###### Obsidian Mantle of Devotion

`'Wrap thyself in my embrace and succumb to my infinite love. Let your breath drift from you like candle smoke, dreaming deeper and deeper still'` ([Obsidian Mantle of Devotion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Mantle_of_Devotion#Obsidian_Mantle_of_Devotion)).

The act of devotion present in mantle's name, given `Wrap thyself in my embrace and succumb to my infinite love` likely means the complete one's surrender to Apocrea's means.

The quote `my infinite love`, based on the other instances of first person, allows us to conclude that it is Apocrea speaking and referring to itself.

`Let your breath drift from you like candle smoke, dreaming deeper and deeper still` quote, then, seemingly refers to the result of this devotion. The act of smoke drifting reminds us of an idea of breath leaving the body -- death, or souls leaving the body. The act of dreaming in that regard seems supernatural, as if being possessed. In combination with smoke metaphor, we would suggest a state of possession, wherein one's soul is extracted, leaving the body without it in a state, similar to a slumber, but animated.

The `infinite love` is peculiar, as it offers only this state of being. In combination with act of devotion we would offer an interpretation, where the act of succumbing to infinite love is one of oblivion, death, of being utilized as the fuel for the engine, as devotion is an act of giving. And, according to Danford, Apocrea's ultimate goal as one of negation of existence through collection of souls and funneling them to the engines.

While this is a more grim interpretation, it conflicts with individuality of those followers, as Apocrea speaks to them. But, in case of devotion, and prior interpretation of influence, this individuality is either suppressed or removed as the last state of follower's being. When devotion is absolute, and becouse of it, the devotee may offer themselves -- which is colloqually being the soul, [contrary to an aura](#auras-and-souls), -- to Apocrea.

From this reversed perspective death becomes not an oblivion, but a tarted by Apocrea state of being within `primordial black` or as a fuel for the engine. The latter scenario may be seen as more grim, as oblivion of the metaphysical state of `primordial black` is not achieved by the soul, but the soul is repurposed to become engine's fuel. Whether those states are identical, is unknown, as it depends on metaphysical properties of the black, -- whether it is alchemical void of potential, or it is a final state of existence devoid of energy. The priomordial of the black makes us think of the prior, alchmical interpretation of massa confusa, but the exact conclusion requires us to discuss nature of the Void proper and then its relation to `primordial black`.

###### Apocrea's Eldritch Madness

As presented in [Obsidian Mantle of Devotion](#obsidian-mantle-of-devotion), Apocrea offers potentially terrible fate of becoming engine's fuel as an ambrace of `infinite love` -- this framing is opposed to Dnford's madness, in which he is seemingly acknowledges Apocrea's negative perspective, while remaining in the world of living: `What terrible naivety! What utter farce! All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! Though they may steal sanctuary in the cracks and corners of their terrible realm, it is ever fleeting. The blinding gaze of the Apocrea is boundless. The daylight, the starlight; all hope is merely waiting for their dark shroud to return this cosmic play to its primordial black. Dear heavens! The stars grin down with lustful intent! It is an abomination, an embodiment of sublime beauty, dark and blooded! I weep and laugh before the shroud that waits!` ([Recovered from the journal of Prof. Allister Danford, Dean of Antiquities - Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

The confict becomes existential, as it reqires for perception of reality without a filter, while remaining human, -- a madness in lovecraftian and cosmic horror terms.

We will keep track of this notion of madness, as we are yet to discuss a figure of the Architect, which is stated to possess madness: `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

##### Obsidian Prize Box

As far as those items' origins go, we have the last one -- the Obsidian Prze Box itself, as well as its [announcement](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276): `Plucked from the depths of the Apocrean realm, Obsidian Prize boxes are almost certainly guaranteed to not induce madness upon ownership. There is literally almost no chance you will hide one deep within your family cellar and pour over its intricate, arcane craftsmanship. And opening one will not in any way unleash a terrible, ancient entity from a world of unending, dark dreams into your own. No, instead, the Obsidian Prize Box contains an assortment of unique and very rare Apocrean treasures. These ageless, undying antiquities include: ... Plus a bonus chance for even more prizes! 25% chance for all Obsidian Prize Boxes to also contain Shadow Accessories`.

The origin of the box allows us to suggest with high certainty that the obsidian sets come from Apocrean Realm, rather than being constructed in the material realm, if we assuma that the originof prize box itself matches source of its contents: `Plucked from the depths of the Apocrean realm, Obsidian Prize boxes`.

The reveal of those items, apart from cosmic horror tropes, introduces Apocrea to material realm: `opening one will not in any way unleash a terrible, ancient entity from a world of unending, dark dreams into your own`. As here a reference goes to a single entity we can conclude it being either an aspect of Apocrea's presence or a native to Apocrean Realm being, such as Apocrean Harvester. Presence of such entity in the material realm is framed as destructive, characteristic of lovecraftian narratives, wherein presence of alien or eldritch beings is one harmful or explicitly malevelent towards humanity.

The Apocrean Realm in that case is called a `world of unending, dark dreams`. We will track this _relation to dreams and ability of Apocrea to dream_, as it is most similar to the Sleeper, as the thematic and metaphysical parallels here are most distinct. Yet, due to unexplored nature of Sleeper, we will cover this motif of dreams separately.

As far as disciples' gear suggests, it represents both characteristic aspects of Apocrea, and the type of relation of the disciples to the deity. All of those concepts are tied to lovecraftian horror, usually involving rituals, performed by devoted cultists, in order to summon eldritch entities, witnessing or seeing which can cause madness. This interpretaion based on lovecraftian narrative may explain nature of the ritual as one required to open a Shroud, but with no certainty as we have not discussed the ritual itself in detail.

The [Apocrean Disciple Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Disciple_Wings) imply that those are granted through the connection to Apocrea, as those have the same design as the Apocrean Crown, which is made, likely, of obsidian, given its mineral-like texture and shape, as well as our previous discussion [on identification of obsidian as the unnatural stone](#unnatural-stone-of-apocrean-realm). In a [corresponding news art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SpiralKnights_News_94-big.png) there is a depiction of an Apocrean disciple possessing both wings and a crown, which may imply a hierarchy within the cult and a varying degree of devotion.

There are also some architectural motifs, but those are likely an asset reuse: Graveyard of [Blades of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen) outside of Haven contains an obelisk, are shaped as miniature versions of the ziggurat found in the [Obsidian Nexus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus), if a case of asset reuse to be omitted. It is also important to note in the context of tortodrones: Call of The Colossi contains the same rectangular obelisk located to to the left of the entrance elevator and before the arena, suggesting that it is the result of the same cultural and architectural phenomenon of ritual circles being introduced to Cradle and its civilizations from the Underworld.

In relation to eldritch madness, it is explicitly reintated in the announcement -- `Obsidian Prize boxes are almost certainly guaranteed to not induce madness upon ownership`, and identification of the gear as an `assortment of unique and very rare Apocrean treasures. .. ageless, undying antiquities ...`,we may suggest that those cultists' gear had existed prior to Skylark crash landing on Cradle, and, if the anatomy of this gear is depicted as it is, it would mean _existence of Isorans in the past, which had taken the role of cultists_.

Lastly, there is the motif of dreams, but before we discuss it, we will recap existing image of Apocrea as an entity.

##### Underworld and Apocrean Realm

Finally it is important to specify connection of Underworld and Apocrean Realm in their common relation to souls, partially covered in the [Minerals and Souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).

Everfrost tower brought from Underworld functions as a prison for souls. Then there are auras, which Black Kats consume. Apocrea creates dimensional traps, a shroud, across Clockworks, which lead up to the plateau -- the hunting grounds of Apocrean Harvester.

<!--In relation to Apocrea, one entity may be seen as native to Underworld -- [Scarabs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarab), -- as they can be coupled with even devilites across [Grasping Plateau](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau).-->

Amongst those elements one thing in particular is important: `The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap` ([Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus)), -- an ability to warp reality, a more unique ability among existing ecosystem of Cradle. This ties with the prior concept of the Plateau of Leng and Grasping Plateau as connected, as both exist in an undefined state, between the dimensions or realms, including dreams.

Due to those properties of Apocrean Realm, even without a propostion, where ritual circles and graviton technology were given to Underworld, we propose that __Apocrea presents far greater longer term danger not only to Cradle, but material realm__.

The motivation behind Apocrea's actions suggest an essential aspect of souls to their existence or [plan](#apocreas-goal-of-negation-of-existence-part-1).

This relation would mean that souls are formed or at least arrive to material realm from a different reality, which we assume to exist given prior instance of heavenly kingdom, and more broadly, __a divine realm opposed to curretly established pantheon of Underworld and eldritch deities, if we were to follow general pattaern of a mythological narrative__. Therefor, souls are naturally unreachable for Apocrea, but souls are also likely meant to remain in Underworld or Abyss as a frozen prison at the bottom of Underworld.

##### Metaphysical Stack

It is here that we can begin to build a topology of presented realms, based on the concept of energy and souls, -- a _vertical stack of realms_, -- where __souls flow from top to the bottom of the world, perpetuated by symbolism and mythology__.

We propose that at the very bottom of this stack it is either the Apocrean Realm, as it seemingly exists outside of a general structure -- `in the deep dark below, beyond the space where time wakens and yawns, beyond the shadows cast by the great leviathan of eternity` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)) with the `primordial blackness`, or 2 other candidates -- Blinding Abyss and the Void.

In the [analysis of the Blinding Abyss](#perma-frostifurs-and-blinding-abyss) and its properties we came to conclusion that it is [the frozen bottom of Underworld](#return-to-blinding-abyss-and-maulos).

The Void, on the other hand, requires for us to analyze 3 more time periods, where in laws of this universe's cosmology are observed.

Material realm is connected with Underworld. Usually only souls can leave from material realm to Underworld. Souls can choose to stay and haunt material realm to lesser extent. [The Core had disrupted this process](#state-of-cradle-metaphysics), allowing souls to return to material realm, breaking the boundary separating material realm and Underworld, acceleratig the transition between states of the living, death and undeath.

Living beings can traverse across both Underworld andmaterial realm through a ritual circle made of charged with energy minerals, or a device, such as grim gates, which itself uses energy-based principles revolving around universal medium of energy, which in that case takes form of charged data and energy storage -- glyphs.

Some of other energy mediums _allow existence of consciousness, creating souls_. One with a soul can be trapped at the precipise of Apocrean Realm, the Shroud, and through those means both enter Apocreanrealm and return back into material realm with external assistance.

Undercorp is located at the Underworld. Below the Underworld, it is Apocrean Realm, an even more ancient location. Both realms might possess means of communication. Those realms have access to the material realm. Apocrea disrupts tranfer of souls to Underworld, instead funneling them into its engines as fuel. Those engines are designed to unmake present reality and return it to an initial state of nothingness -- `primordial black`.

In the end, apart from the Void, one final realm remains -- Nameless Realm: `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` ([Chaos cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak)). We will revisit this realm later, as in order to analyze it, we have to cover rest of past history, specifically [Kingdom of Almire](#chapter-vi-kingdom-of-almire) and [Owlites, and Kat Tribe](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

##### Metaphysics of Dreams: Part 1 - Apocrea

Apocrean Realm is an eldritch location with theme of dreams, so it must be analyzed on the motif of dreams in relation to Outer Gods of Lovecraft's universe. This notion of dreams will be [later](#metaphysics-of-dreams-part-2-sleeper) important in the context of the Sleeper's name and reflection of act of dreaming onto reality.

Apocrea dreams and creates into reality machines powered by souls. At the same time, souls are sought after by Apocrea for potentially other uses. Here, they are presented as metaphorical fruits, and given the presence of the sun and a tree, we suggest it being more literal -- that as if souls were flowing from a higher realm, and then in the established contexts drawn to to taken by Apocrea.

As Dreamlands were already mentioned as a potential inspiration behind the design of the obsidian architecture, we will touch upon the role of dreams in Yog-Sothothery:

- Carter had to travel to the Dreamlands in search of the sunset city he manifested through his own act of dreaming in the past. It is suggested by Nyarlathotep that the city was stollen in the dreamlands of Earth by the Old Gods, but this information cannot be trusted, as Carter had to cross interdimensional void to reach Sunset city.
- Nature of dreams under certain conditions allows transportation into other realities, traversal through those realities, higher dimensions, other physical locations, and time periods. This property of dreams is examined in the stories relating to Randolph Carter.

Outside of Yog-Sothothery, but present in popular culture is the myth of _Azathoth dreaming the existence itself_ -- the reality exists as long as Azathoth sleeps.

The case of Azathoth's act of dreaming is defined _in later installments_, in particular, _Henry Kuttner's_ `Hydra` of _Lovecraft Circle of works_, wherein Azathoth is directly responsible for existence. Here we note the _motif of dreaming_ as an act of creation or definition of reality, as in case of Azathoth its perpetual dream is the humananity-inhabited reality:

<BookCitation source="The dream-Quast of Unknown Kadath - H.P.Lovecraft">

  ...shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe, where no dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine of accursed flutes;

  ...

  ...no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon Azathoth in the formless central void.

</BookCitation>

Followed by the reveal of deity' power:

<BookCitation source="Hydra - Henry Kuttner">

  It was very near the Center, the Center of Chaos, where dwells Azathoth, the Lord of All Things. All that exists was created by the thoughts of Azathoth, and only in the Center of Ultimate Chaos could Scott find means to live again on earth in human form. There is an erasure in Edmond’s notes at this point, and it is only possible to make out the fragment: “... of thought made real.”

</BookCitation>

It should be noted that Lovecraft's depiction of cosmic horror and its deities differs significantly from works of fiction within lovecaftian setting written and developed under collegue writers' vision, other than Lovecraft himself, _reinterpret and reimagined both to fit a different setting or as a further development of the genree in its own right, an homage_.

It is within this later context role of Azathoth colloqually perceived as of a dreamer-creator god. For now we will consider through Azathoth the act of dreaming potentially as fundamental as creation of existence, with lesser options being varying acts of creation of matter of different complexity.

This framework will be our sarting point on the investigation of nature of Sleeper's act of dreaming.

### _Chapter `VII` &#160;<br>_ Kingdom of Almire

<SubTitleCentered>
<em>"You can feel it in the smoldering air -- an eternal will holding this place together, never allowing its inhabitants to rest."<small> - Gratz</small></em>
</SubTitleCentered>

We begin from a time when kingdom of Almire was invaded.

For the first time a certain war is mentioned in the Owlite tome within the [Forgotten Library](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep#Gate_Map) of Owlite Keep, a library of Owlite Academia of Magics:

- `...This world has seen few greater tragedies than the fall of the great Kingdom of Almire. Once a vibrant, beautiful realm of lush forests and sweeping plains...`
- `...neighboring kingdoms declared war...`
- `...seeking the power needed to turn the tide, Lord Vanaduke of Almire fled into the mountains...`
- `...returning as something unnatural...`
- `...endless inferno...`
- `...Almire destroyed...`
- `...they can never leave, they can never escape the flames...` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep - The Forgotten Library - Owlite tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_tome_text_Dialogue/The_Forgotten_Library)).

In the same mission we have descriptions of what was left of Kingdom of Almire by the time Isorans crash land on Cradle: `A few of the spookats that call it home contacted one of our visiting Recon Knights and provided details of the negative energy mass that has appeared above the Core. Calling it 'a place of burning hatred' and 'a prison for dark souls' they say that you can read all about it in 'one of those weird Owlite books' in an Owlite keep they pinpointed` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep)), and retelling of Recon Rangers: `Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)). The book the spookats were referring is one at the Forgotten Library.

We are presented with an omnious phrase, `they can never leave, they can never escape the flames`, and a characteristic which spookats provide as a `place of burning hatred` and `a prison for dark souls`, referring to at least Firestorm Citadel, as it is the subject of discussion during [Ending in Fire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire) -- `massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)), -- and at worst the totality of Almire idenified by its other locations, such as the [Necropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds) of [Legion of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire) danger mission.

In-game content creates a vague description of the timeline, mostly outlining general themes and events, but we can find a more precise and detailed description of those events, one which further connects the concept of [fire deity](#fiendish-cults), Lord Vanaduke, and that war.

#### `Almire's Fall`

The existence of 3 kingdoms, their ongoing conflict, and the aftermath are given by a short story of [`Almire's Fall`](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263), recited in its entirety:

<BookCitation source="Almire's Fall - Cory Sponseller">

  The citadel comes from a land divided by constant war between the nations of three kingdoms. The smallest of the three, known as Almire, was a land of lush, beautiful trees and golden fields. It was ruled by a young and determined king known as Lord Vanaduke. Praised for his military ability, it was because of this that Almire was a powerful nation despite it being the smallest of the three. Given time it could expand to a mighty empire. It was because of this the other two kings feared him and formed a truce to invade Almire.

  Vanaduke's army was stretched too thin and Almire quickly began to fall under the weight of the two combined armies. From atop the highest tower of the Grand Citadel of Almire, Vanaduke watched his kingdom crumble. Slowly going mad from the stress, he fled from the citadel and vanished into the mountains, vowing that he would one day reclaim his throne. Leaving behind his family, his people and his homeland, Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths.

  He tirelessly searched the mountains for many years, no longer the man he was before, but a mad hermit. Then one day he discovered a small cave that radiated with unnatural warmth, smelling of ash and sulfur. Within it he discovered a great chamber whose floor was waist deep in ashes. They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable.

  Vanaduke began to speak, softly at first, saying the names of his family, the names of the kings before him and the towns of Almire. He repeated this like a chant, increasing in intensity until he began shouting. With this he began shouting the names of the kings of the other kingdoms and all the wrongs they committed against his kingdom. He cried out to the god of the mountain to punish them, to give him the strength to take his kingdom back. In his frenzy he looked to the face of the deity and in it he began to see the face deform. The image burned into his eyes and brain like cinders, and contained that which sounded like the screaming of foreign tongues and war drums. With this, Vanaduke began to sink into the ash. He choked on the ash as it pulled him below, tasting sulfur his screams now sounding of roaring flames.

  Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him.

  There the cursed king has remained since, in an ashen throne of a burning kingdom, surrounded by all the lost souls of the people that once served him. And it is there that the king still mercilessly destroys any who dare enter his kingdom, however much the ashen shadow of what is was the rivers flowed with clear water and the leaves of the trees glittered like emeralds under the shining sun.

</BookCitation>

Before we continue, we need to discuss the context and origin of entry itself.

##### Diegesis of `Almire's Fall`

Almire's Fall lore entry [had originated on the official wiki](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263), rather than forums or items' descriptions, as discovered by `Spiralka-chan` on the `Arcade` Discord server.

The [edit shows](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263) that the author of this story snippet is a member of developers' team. We will work from an assumption, that the entry is canon to the story, but with a few caveats regarding its in-universe placement.

As the entry is present on the wiki, it may render wiki itself as present in the inner organization structure of Spiral Order on Cradle.

Previously at chapter's introducton we discussed the tome at the Forgotten Library of Owlite Keep. We assume that it was likely wrtten by Owlites, but as `Almire's Fall` contains details which would be impossible to observe -- events within the mountain shrine's chamber -- we would identify the story's narrator as external to the setting's universe.

Despte this detail, Owlites do acknowledge this sequence of events of Lord Vanaduke dissappearing, `fleeing` into the mountains:

- `...seeking the power needed to turn the tide, Lord Vanaduke of Almire fled into the mountains...`
- `...returning as something unnatural...`
- `...endless inferno...`
- `...Almire destroyed...`
- `...they can never leave, they can never escape the flames...` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep - The Forgotten Library - Owlite tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_tome_text_Dialogue/The_Forgotten_Library))

We propose that `Almire's Fall` was _not originally written by Spiral Order_. Despite this, researchers of Haven Laboratory did discover more information regarding kingdom of Almire, given present artifacts of past civilizations including Almire, as well as a dialogue with one of biotechs studying [Almirian Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Seal_(Furniture)): `there were massive citadels housing Almire's armed forces and great estates for its noble houses ... We assume the kingdom is still a smoldering ruin somewhere`.

More so, there is [Almire Furniture Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture_Box): `Those of you who are brave enough to visit the Firestorm Citadel may have seen glimpses of the magnificence that once was the Kingdom of Almire. No, too busy being on fire? Before Vanaduke brought the curse of fire and ash, Almire was prosperous and beautiful. Haven Treasury has assembled the Almire Furniture Box to help recreate this lost kingdom. Some items are charred beyond repair. Others are carefully restored to their former glory. Find chairs, rugs, tapestries, benches and tables from Almire for your Guild Hall. The box also includes Nature Sprites and Cursed Nature Sprites. Does your guild better commune with the Spirit Mother in her faraway realm?` ([Decorate your Guild Hall with the splendors of Almire!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102786)).

Due to Isoran research, but data-first approach of the wiki, knowledge of Owlites about the general timeline coupled with _script's style_ as more characteritic -- less analytical, dramatic, -- of Owlites attempting to preserve an image of Almire, as much as Spiral Order was gathering information about Almire, __we propose that the script was recovered by Spiral Order from Owlites__.

Both Owlite and Isoran civilization had to work with the currently fallen, cursed state of the kingdom, therefore we can compare the research performed by Owlites and Isorans. Notably, both Isorans and Owlites arrive to an image of Almire before it had burned, as related to nature: `... Almire, was a land of lush, beautiful trees and golden fields` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263)):

- For Owlites it is a quote from their tome: `Once a vibrant, beautiful realm of lush forests and sweeping plains...` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep - The Forgotten Library - Owlite tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_tome_text_Dialogue/The_Forgotten_Library)).
- For Isorans: `Before Vanaduke brought the curse of fire and ash, Almire was prosperous and beautiful. Haven Treasury has assembled the Almire Furniture Box to help recreate this lost kingdom. ... Others are carefully restored to their former glory. ... The box also includes Nature Sprites and Cursed Nature Sprites. Does your guild better commune with the Spirit Mother in her faraway realm?` ([Decorate your Guild Hall with the splendors of Almire!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102786)).

  A restoration of Almirian architecture and culture was performed with _direct acknowledgedment of_ __a divine link with the Spirit Mother__: `Does your guild better commune with the Spirit Mother in her faraway realm?` ([Decorate your Guild Hall with the splendors of Almire!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102786)).

Those elements allow us to begin to parse the timeline with most context now being provided, as well as establish a supernatural motif found both in the cursed condition of Almire and divine nature of Spirit Mother.

#### Three Kingdoms

There are 2 kingdoms specified to exist, which had `formed a truce to invade Almire` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263)).

It is likely that in order to invade kingdom of Almire, they had to be located in proximity of Almire, likely bordering it due to 2 notable elemnts of the short story:

- Their reasoning of Almire having a potential of gaining more power, and, as an empire, subsequent land.
- `Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)). The timeframe of a day may be specific to Owlites writing a story while emphasizing army's danger. Despite it, the danger is present, and with a short timeframe emphasizing Lord Vanaduke's intensity, it implies traversal over land.

We have previously proposed identity of Almire as Isorans [through distinction of their auras and souls](#almire-and-isoran-souls), then, as those kingdoms are stated to be distinct nations: `The citadel comes from a land divided by constant war between the nations of three kingdoms` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), we would identify them as, too, Isorans.

We propose those 2 kingdoms are related to northern Raiders, first introduced [in the context of Isorans general](#mythological-framing-of-spiral-raiders), and the kingdom of Ironmight -- one not mentioned yet, but one we will explore in detail.

This proposal at its base stems from the idea of all 3 kingdoms being descendants of ancient, but already spacefaring [Isorans](#spacefarers-of-old) -- we have discussed plausibility of this concept in the [analysis of Ghost in the Machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine). The general idea behind this logic is based on the context and designs of [Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine) _as being an Isoran or Morai vessel_.

And, as Iron Hulk is at least hundred years old, while greater Isoran spacefaring civilization is far older, `eons`, specifically, this would allow for a plausible narrative of Isoran vessel to be on a planet preceeding Cradle within a certain curcumstances, which would allow for Almire and other kingdoms to emerge within a far more primitive technologocal era, identified by the designs of [Raider equipment](#mythological-framing-of-spiral-raiders).

If Cradle or a planet preceding it was already found prior is such framing, time span of several hundred of years of Iron Hulk does not become an upper limit for Isoran connection to Cradle and a planet preceeding it.

#### Kingdom of Ironmight

The name Ironmight, or, if we refer to it properly, a Kingdom of Ironmight, makes us think of other similar instances or naming conventions of empires and kingdoms:

- _Kingdom of the Netherlands_, meaning a lower land, lower elevation, a property of geographical location.
- _United Kingdom_, one that consists of multiple entities united by a monarch.
- _Holy Roman Empire_ combines an adjective with a city of Rome.

"Ironmight" has a similar morphology. It is derived from a descriptive term of might and is combined with iron resulting in "the might of iron." We suggest that it is a kingdom, one similar to Almire, with part of its identity being rooted in a few potential notions:

- its military power if might of iron is to be read as weapons made of iron. But kingdom of Almire already possesses that characteristic;
- Accent on smelting and forge;
- It is economic might, while not iron, it will be discussed as a particularly interesting interpretation given further discussion.

The basis for the Ironmight, as the name itself, we extract from the [Ironmight set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail). Through those items we can start to notice relations between the kingdoms before their conflict.

The concept of a kingdom of Ironmight was also presented separately from our research by [user Magnicth on Spiral Knight subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/spiral_knights/comments/zakpe/the_ironmight_theory/) with our further analysis of crown currency coinciding with theirs.

##### Motif of Stars

The glowing emblem on the [Ironmight Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Shield) -- `A superior shield forged from sun silver. The meaning of the crest on its face has been lost to time`, -- __is identical to emblem of a crown engraved on the coins found across Clockworks__ persisting on Cradle to this day.

The dimensions of the currency and shield's emblem are identical. There are __matching star symbols at the cardinal direction on the outer ring__ of the emblem and of the [coins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crowns#Finding_Crowns) _of all nominal values_.

This particular design seems intentional due to application of that symbol on the shield specifically.

The other similar shield with a mysterious glowing emblem, the [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield), also is of inerest to us due to its glowing emblem, but it will be covered separately.

Could presence of stars mean symbolic location of the crown -- the monarch of a kingdom, -- in the center of the Universe or night sky, as one surrounded or protected by stars? Or, is the kingdom ruling over stars in all cardinal directions as if being located at their symbolic center, in the center of known mediavalistic Universe? We refer to this motif here as often a monarch would've been considered a divine ruler, through the application of the concept of the _Divine Right of Kings_. While this can be assumed for Ironmight kingdom, we also have similar theme of divinity in Almire, due to [their connection to Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother).

One thing is particular may point in that thematic direction is the description of the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore): `An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above. It is often completely wasted on crowns and jewelry for slime royalty` ([Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore)). From the celestial ore one other element of kingship or monarchy is made -- [Ice Queen Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown), as it uses Celestial Ore in its alchemy.

It is common across history for crowns be made of rare, precious metals, but also that same notion can be attributed coins. In case of Spiral Knight, crowns, which are also metallic as seen from their designs.

In this interpretation, _kingdom's currency had persisted on Cradle far past the kingdom itself_, while being adopted by slime royalty and other civilizations later into the timeline, including modern-day gremlins.

There is also presence of [sun silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver#Usage), which was present in Isoran equipment -- such as [Azure Guardian armor and weapons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Armor) and [Valkyrian armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail), as well as the [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger), which was discussed in relation to the [Heavenly Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor) in [similarity of Isorans to Valkyries]().

There might be a greater link to a heavenly kingdom referred by Valkyries, as not a strictly physical place, given [origins of castles](), but bordering a potentially divine physical realm -- an idea at its concept resembling the myth regarding Asgard of Norse mythology through existence of Valkyries within heavenly kingdom, -- as motif of stars coupled with present [metaphysics](#metaphysical-stack) may result in discovery of such divine or heavenly realm, associated with stars.

As we are observing this design now separately from Ironmight kingdom, we should point out a design of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke armor, which we will later discuss in greatest details, so far only acknowledging it -- __the star or sun-shaped metallic design around the visor of his armor__.

<!--Motif of stars also emerges across Royal Jelly Palace Echo Stone:
- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS`
- `YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD`
- `HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace)).-->

##### Proficiency with Metals

The [Ironmight Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail) mentioned rare metals in its descriptions: `Superior plate mail forged from an alloy of several rare metals. Its restrictive, but incredibly strong` ([Ironmight Plate Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail)).

From the currently present metals in an established cosmology we possess a following roster:

- `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky` ([Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver)). It has a relation to heavens and the sun, a metal [made from refinement](#lack-of-damage-types) of the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore).
- `A rare metal recovered from a shattered mountain deep within the realm of the Apocrea` ([Perplexing Element](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perplexing_Element)). This metal does not seem to be related to the current case of Almire nor any other kingdoms due to its thematc and context shift.
- `An extraordinary metal imbued with the creeping darkness of the Underworld` ([Shadow Steel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Steel)). Although it was covered in relation to Underworld, this metal does not seem to be related to the current case. Shadow Steel usually provides shadow defense which is absent for this armor.
- `An extraordinary metal imbued with the savage spirit of the wild` ([Primal Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Ore)). It is related to a few piercing-related gear, amongst which Kat Tribe equipment is notable. It is also explicitly stated to be an `extraordinary metal`, further linking ores to metals.
- `An extraordinary metal imbued with the blazing energy of magma` ([Volcanic Iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron)). It is absent in the volcanic plate set, but is present in the similar in design [Volcanic Demo set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Demo_Suit).

Both [volcanic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail) and [ironmight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail) variants of plate armor utilize rare samples of wood:

- `A sturdy chunk of fine, unfinished wood. It's typically used in the production of cabinets` ([Redwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood)).
- `A peculiar piece of wood that just won't stay put` ([Driftwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood)).
- `A pristine log of one of the hardest substances known to the Spiral Knights` ([Ironwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood)).

All of those samples of wood are directly used in the alchemy of Ironmight and Volcanic armor sets and shields, suggesting presence of advanced enough technology.

While those names are present in real world, here their properties are _recontextualized for fantasy-adjacent setting_, most evident by the description of Ironwood: `A pristine log of one of the hardest substances known to the Spiral Knights` ([Ironwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood)).

<!--Ironwood through its name, description, and recipes, serves a strategic role as the base material for the armor manufactured by Ironmight kingdom. We will return to other types of wood later in the [context of gremlin operations](#twisting-trees-and-wyverns) and an additional _5-star wood material, wyrmwood_, discussed there, as it is not yet relevant for Ironmight armor.-->

Those similarities between two plate sets, we propose, imply a common origin.

Coupled with the description of [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield), `It is so resistant to high temperatures that its a mystery how exactly it was forged in the first place`, we suggest that creation of such armor set would require a preficiency with near-magical or elemental materials, therefore knowledge of the specifics of the metaphysics of souls and energy.

Specifically, it is the [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul) which are used in the alchemy of volcanic set, `A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage` ([Flame Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul)) which establish a connection between fire and rage, _elevating it from symbolic to supernatural_.

##### Familiarity with Volcanic Iron and Souls

The [Volcanic Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Helm) uses flame soul in alchemy, but volcanic iron in its description: `A superior plate helmet forged from volcanic iron. It's difficult to breathe in, but it can resist high temperatures and any number of savage attacks` ([Volcanic Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Helm)).

On the other hand, the suggested design is universal across plated armors, such as [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor) which we have proposed to belong to tortomega and adapted to Isoran anatomy. And, _given fiery themes of fallen Almire, would volcanic plate armor rather fit to them, rather than Kingdom of Ironmight_?

The [Volcanic Plate set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail) has elemental defenses, but [Ironmight set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail) has piercing defenses, which is reminiscent of Spiral Order's Cobalt armor alchemy tree.

This scenario was already covered in relation to Spiral Order main line of armors, apart from [padded armor alchemy tree](#padded-armor), and here we may observe a similar scenario of a lack of knowledge of other damage types due to absence of encounters with such entities during that period of civilization's development.

<!--With Almire being located near the mountains with a deity's shrine inside: `Then one day he discovered a small cave that radiated with unnatural warmth, smelling of ash and sulfur. Within it he discovered a great chamber whose floor was waist deep in ashes. They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable. ... citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), -- it is certain that some actor had to carve this shrine with precise knowledge of the deity behind it.-->

As the armor is imbued with the [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul) and forged of [volcanic iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron), in a volcano, given shield's description: `It is so resistant to high temperatures that it's a mystery how exactly it was forged in the first place` ([Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield)), we suggest that [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul) and [volcanic iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron), `An extraordinary metal imbued with the blazing energy of magma`, are metaphysically connected.

We propose that this relation is found in an idea of __flame soul being present within volcanic iron__ -- giving it its elemental affiliation, -- as much as essences are associated with elements and reflect this coinnection within entities which may contain those essences, such as [ornate gun puppies]() and [sealed lumbers](#lumbers-as-constructs).

This framework can be applied onto the [Volcanic Plate Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield): `A superior shield imbued with the elemental essence of flame. It is so resistant to high temperatures that it's a mystery how exactly it was forged in the first place`, as well as onto the rest of Volcanic gear -- that of volcanic iron containing and being imbued with essence of flame or flame souls.

A connection can be drawn with the concept introduced in the [minerals and souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1) between minerals capable of containing energy and essence of fire being present within metal. [Fire Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul) themselves, we suggest, are aggravated [Flame Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul), as flame souls are inherently linked to the elemental nature of enemies, and potentially, Lord Vanaduke's curse and fire deity within the mountain, as their influence, as the curse of that origin, had bound Almirian Souls to material realm and [corporeal bodies](#corporeal-body) in the similar manner to [static souls being bound to machinery across Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine).

In case of Iron Hulk, the souls were haunting the vessel without external will of supernatural force, while flame souls -- Almirians, -- are bound to their bodies by malign presence of curse. The [Ghost in The Machine narrative](#ghosts-in-the-machine) we have initially [explored in means of establishing a foundation for present metaphysical framework](#cradle-metaphysics-part-1), wherein we have noted on the presence of lost souls both for Firestorm Citadel and Dry Docks.

By following this logic, we can identify _elemental alignment of lost souls hinting at specifics of their death or undead affliction_.

Yet, whether Volcanic Plate set of armor belongs to Almire, due to their proximity to mountains, or Ironmight kingdom, due to latter's potential possession of the technology, is unknown.

<!--The glowing symbol on shield's front face can potentially be related to the glow of [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) and intricate patterns found on inner side of [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist) as well as other tortodrone-related gear. But as far as we are aware of setting's metaphysics, no reason apart from the design can be drawn for now.-->

#### Almire and Spirit Mother

Almirian regalia is based on a medieval crown, most clearly seen on the [Almirian Restored Tapestry](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Restored_Tapestry#Restored_Tapestry): _a crown, through which grows a dark branching tree with red leaves_. In the Isoran restored variation of the emblem, there are _white wings at the foundation of black roots_, which we suggested to be design changes made by [Isorans specifically](#isoran-designs-of-almire), rather than being features native to ancient Almire, as both Blackened Crest and regular Lord Vanaduke's mantle lacks those.

It can be concluded that those are tree branches rather that black symmetrical ironwork, based on the design of [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire), where presence of red leaves is most distinct.

The tree, as a symbolic element of a crest, is associated with nature. There are nature-themed designs are seen across [all restored furniture](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture_Box), reminiscent of water fountains of the Spirit Mother and her [Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite), suggesting a deeper connection of this figure with _kingdom's lineage_.

Theme of nature and root is also present for [Nature Sprite at the Overgrown Court](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Overgrown_Court): `Yes, we nature sprites are the rain, the root, and the soil. But you are not like us. You are like the ones below. ... Good fortune, star-borne`. [Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite) have colored fur coat and furry, striped ears. Notably, they possess a similar to devilites body shape, elongated ears and back small wings. At a closer inspection, wings are detached from Sprites' back, while seemingly being comprised of stone material with an engraved spiral at their base.

Then, Sprites are capable of being cursed which restricts there power and severs a link to the realm of Spirit Mother: `Without the power of the rest of the sprites, water will never flow through this realm. It requires a focus link with the Spirit Mother to bring even the smallest drops of water into such an oppressive world. The master of this realm has seen to it that the flames surrounding him will always burn. Then you are brave as well traveler. You can find my kinsfolk throughout the whole of this court. Be very careful though, for Vanaduke's terrible minions are guarding them. Many patrol the main drag, so watch your back as you move about. Once you find a sprite, carry them back to the sacred circle you see before you. They are no doubt weakened from Vanaduke's curse and will require rejuvenation. When six others are reunited we will form a focus link with the Spirit Mother and bring water to the wells` ([Firestorm Citadel - Charred Court - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court)).

Nature Sprites have seemingly less developed civilization, as suggested by their designs of, notably, painted masks with a single vertical stroke. The paint also covers Sprites' ears in 2 symmetrical stokes on each ear. So far we have only observed the color of _yellow, blue, and green_. In terms of association with minerals, they may relate to less confrontational aspects thoose minerals represent:

- `A fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it` ([Luminite]()).
- `A fabled mineral of a brilliant, blue color said to contain the knowledge and origins of all worlds` ([Moonstone]()).
- `A fabled mineral of a vibrant green color said to contain the essence of all natural life` ([Valestone]()).

Nature sprites also distinguish Isorans as star-borne, `Greetings again, star-borne one. Star-borne?; Yes, we nature sprites are the rain, the root, and the soil. But you are not like us. You are like the ones below` ([Shadowplay - Overgrown Court - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court)), which ties back albeit symbolically to their characteric as alien to Cradle species, or, as `celestial` civilization.

##### Deific Presence

It is here we are provided with seemingly metaphorical relation of Nature Sprites to Spirit Mother: `we nature sprites are the rain, the root, and the soil` ([Shadowplay - Overgrown Court - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court)), as if they were an embodiment of nature, as `the essence of all natural life` ([Valestone]()).

The fiendish sigils depicted on the sacred circle at the center of the court possess green hue suggesting them being drawn with Valestone, if we assume the pattern of circles of art being made of minerals.

The act of establishing the `focus link`: `When six others are reunited we will form a focus link with the Spirit Mother and bring water to the wells` ([Firestorm Citadel - Charred Court - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court)), seems in this context as a _common metaphysical principal of performing a ritual_ here being an establishment of a link between realms, reminiscent of [the ritual at the devilish drudgery scenario room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_1.png).

The supernatural union of Almire and Spirit Mother, other than through common motif of nature, we suggest, exists partially due to Sprites' devotion to extinguishing the fires, with an externally suggested goal to right Lord Vanaduke's actions: `I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress. Finding and freeing it may prove useful` ([Nameless Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless))).

This connection of Almire with the Spirit Mother -- __her deific presence__, -- is further affirmed through the announcement of [Almire Furniture Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture_Box): `Does your guild better commune with the Spirit Mother in her faraway realm?` ([Decorate your Guild Hall with the splendors of Almire!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102786)). __A communion is offered between Isorans, a guild in particular, and Spirit Mother__. Nature Sprites themselves are then referred back to Spirit Mother: `A spirit of nature willing to wander rather than follow the guide of the Spirit Mother` ([Nature Sprite (Furniture)](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite_(Furniture)#Creatures)).

<!--At that, Almire itself translates from a name in Urdu as "aristocratic", which might serve as a hint at more existing connection through the name's origin to south-east cultures and countries. Specifically, the translation also is suggested to be an "aristocratic lady". Could it be linked to the Spirit Mother? Maybe as a literal kingdom of Spirit Mother, since spirit mother is directly mentioned in relation to the burning kingdom, as it would be her temporary domain, a sanctuary, in the material realm?-->

Then there is power of water from Spirit Mother's Realm: `a force of nature summoned to this realm to extinguish the unnatural fire that is consuming it. ... Now none may proceed beyond the court as columns of shadow fire block all exits. Shadow fire can only be extinguished with the water that flows from these spirit wells. The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself` ([Firestorm Citadel - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite)).

This _particular kind of water_ is framed as the __only tool__ _capable of opposing shadow fires_, latter's nature we will discuss [later](#nature-of-darkfire). This establishes an idea of the shadow fire being dangerous enough to be only extinguishable by _water of supernatural origin_.

We do not know, why among other kingdoms Almire was selected as a kingdom with deific, beneficial presence, which had remained since.

As fire and Lord Vanaduke's effects seemingly possess Underworldly, undead nature, given our later analysis of Lord Vanaduke's affliction, does Spirit Mother's realm become a metaphysical opposite to Underworld?

Thematically it seems so, but, this spirit realm was not encountered or mentioned in any other place across Clockworks while it remains vulnerable to the power of curse. While Valkyries are more revelant in the context of direct opposition to Underworld and fiends, they are contained in their own thematic context, different from one of Spirit Mother. Yet, both Valkyries and Spirit Mother present a force, capable of opposing malign presence of Underworld.

With this context of Underworld's presence, can we find an explanation of Spirit Mother's connection with Almire? We propose an explanation: Almire, by being the closest to the power which had _led to its supernatural damnation and annihilation of nearby kingdoms_, may be a location of interest for presence, which resides in the shrine, being most plausibly an Underworld deity. By proxy of Spirit Mother's realm, her ability to counter those flames, we can assume, creates a __narrative of a prolonged opposition of Underworld and higher realm over the material realm as the ground of direct confrontaion__.

More so, if Nature Sprites state that only this supernatural fire can be extinguished in divine, supernatural means, would this also mean, that _Spirit Mother's realm is the one Valkyries had referred as paradise_?

- `A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` ([Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen)).
- `A cursed crown once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` ([Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen)).

The perception of Spirit Mother's realm as one secluded to a deity of water, roots, and nature seem us as an implication of a greater hierarchy -- a pantheon -- of deities.

As it is stated that Underworld is known to contain many fiendish deities: `One of many statuettes carried by fiends as a means of gaining favor with their dark gods. The most valuable ones are 'MIBE' (mint in box of evil)` ([Wicked Idol](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol)), _why a heavenly, divine realm would not to possess a similar multitide of deities and different names across multiple cultures separated by time_?

##### Deific Realms

We do know that at least Nature Sprites outside of their realm are susceptible to curse which had made them restrained at the Firestorm Citadel within the material realm.

Nature Sprites we imprisoned within the Citadel and, given Lost Soul's framing, this had likely happened long time ago: `I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress` ([Nameless Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)). This does not explicitly mean that Nature Sprites are immortal, but it proves aforementioned belief of their vulnerability to __curse can suppress entities associated with the divine__.

<!--On that notion of divinity, we do have to keep in mind imagery of spirals on Nature Sprites' wings.-->

The motif if vulnerability we can also see, although thematically unfitting, in the [Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm), introduced by the Chaos Cloak: `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` ([Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak)). We are reminded of it due to a special nature of this set, as one vulnerable not only to main status effects, but curse, too.

Although a speculation at that point, _the fact that Nature Sprite does not name Spirit Mother's realm by a distinguished name_ may be a potential reason to be the latter being named as such, -- nameless -- because it is less explored than any other realm?

If we were to apply the prior metaphysical framework of spirit -- souls with auras -- emerging from an unknown realm, would Spirit Mother's realm become this very realm, and the Spirit Mother -- source of all souls, associated and dwelling in water? We believe this is highly likely because this interpretation offers an __archetypical narrative of divine, supernatural mother of spirit with a medium of water both as a carrier for the souls and a universal purifier__.

It is important to note now that Chaos Cloak is an Owlite armor and considering further analysis of Owlite and their advancements in elemental magic, they regard the mantle as forbidden likely due to its connection to the Nameless Realm, which by proxy would _mark the realm itself as dangerous for currently unknown reasons_.

Whether there is a hierarchical connection between Nameless Realm, the heavenly realm of Valkyries, and Spirit Mother's realm, we have yet to explore.

#### Raiders and Pagan Vikings

The last of 3 kingdoms remains unknown.

We have briefly mentioned a relation of Raiders with that period of time. Here we propose that the third kingdom was based on a time period colloquially identified as pop-cultural depiction of vikings. In particular, viking invasions from 8 to 11 century, given name of the [Raider Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box).

We will attempted to analyze raiders in relation to Isorans with a presumption that those items are historically accurate -- that they exist in confinements of the setting according the [prior analysis of raiders relative to established Greek and Norse mythology](#mythological-framing-of-spiral-raiders).

Then there is case of total lack of any, even vague history of Isorans. Apart from them being an ancient spacefaring civilization, a period involving guns in an western theming, and of an existential war with Morai, there is no history of Isoran civilization.

Due to this, any equipment referencing any other less technologically advanced era positions itself into a distinct category tied to capacity of Isorans to [transmute ancient equipment through alchemy](#technology-alchemy-and-isoran-redesigns) but also a distinct out-of-universe inspiration.

We suggest that historical accuracy should be upheld here relative to awareness of _semi-fantastic_, __mediavalistic setting__. At that, we should focus on one of main guiding elements of Isoran technology -- [of lack of advanced damage types](#lack-of-damage-types), -- which are present for this ancient equipment.

<!--Due to this, a release of items related to Isoran past, when their entire history is virtually unknown, seems particular;odd to us, compared to the rest of items being relatively new, as modern enough for plausibility of being wielded by a spacefaring civilization.-->

We propose that Raiders' equipment, apart fom being Isoran, _can be plausibly fit_ into an established time period, specifcally, before Almire was invaded, with raiders becoming the third kingdom.

One notion we have to also mention here, apart from a _concept of raiders not having a kingdom in the first place as going against historically accurate vikings_, is that Cikings in later periods of time were serving as mercenaries, with their presence found in Mediterranean Sea, albeit after their transition from paganism to Christianity. Items of Raider Prize Box bear emblem of a Spiral Warden, a modern design meant to be associted with Spiral Order, suggesting a similarity -- an initially common cultural roots as Isoran.

Here we might think of raider's equipment being designed with Spiral Order or an order of old insignia, but, we only saw the case of utilitarian, functional aspects of equipment being adapted by Spiral Order and _not its cultural background_, and no placement for Spiral Order symbolism, which is present both on the prize box and equipment itself.

Before we proceed further, we have to argue that there is heavenly kingdom of Valkyries, seemingly located above 3 mountains, one of which was `magma-covered` (`A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain` - [Raging Avenger Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Avenger_Helm)).

While they seem as a preferable candidate for the second kingdom, as they are named as such and seem old enough for this time period, _they remain in the sky after fall of Almire_, which contradicts Lord Vanaduke's crusade _after his transformation at the mountain shrine_.

At that, undead zombies are found across castles of heavenly kingdom, in a similar manner to howlitzers, which we [have linked to war with dragons](#howlitzers-dragons-and-drakes). But, as we will discuss further, we believe this element of undeath will be proven relevant in a period of time, happening after Lord Vanaduke's return and fall of other 2 invading kingdoms.

<!--Raiders are seemingly inspired by popularized cultural perception of Vikings, which might suggest a vague time period at which we can operate as well as place the events of Almire's Fall.-->

<!--By presence of [Firestorm Skeggox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Skeggox), `An ornate, fiery axe favored by raiders for its versatility`, with an energy symbol we can confirm this inspiration and relation to Vikings.-->

Based on [Squall Caller](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Squall_Caller): `An ornate hammer infused with the power of a great storm, it's as cutting-edge as a blunt weapon can be`, we can suggest that this period of raiding history relates to a time of norse pagans prior to their christianization and their establishment on European mainland.

This seems important, as the weapon such as Squall Caller, does resemble Mjölnir, a hammer, serving both as a weapon and a tool for thunder god Thor of Norse mythology. This connection to storms may coincide both with an established pattern of _thunder being associated with_ [post-draconic pantheon of gods](#lesser-creaton-myth) and element of storms being modern elemental, as the weapon itself.

At the same time, labeling them as a kingdom, sets them, considering possible mainland location of Almire near mountains, as an already established, organized kingdom which in case of vikings had happened only some time later. Although any division pre- and post- christianization vikings _seems to niche as an inspiration_, it provides context for the themes which were chosen for this group, as the pagan traditions did carry on, the design decisions for the equipment allow us only to speculate so far.

<!-- Apart from that, one other element was not earlier addressed - the key feature of mounted warden's head - [Raider Helm Crest](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Helm_Crest). With the general depiction of a warden, one detail is out of place - the ears, or possibly, horns. Although we can't say for sure if it is the latter and not a change in ears' shape due to model itself, this can potentially mean something. Moreover, this element is depicted on the [prize box itself](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box), as it is seen above warden's eye. Two possible suggestions we can come up with: leaning forwards ears are meant to symbolize alertness, considering raiders' lifestyle, and the other - a depiction of norse myth of Sleipnir, an eight-legged Odin's horse. Sleipnir he was capable of traveling across all nine realms of Norse cosmology, including realm of the dead. -->

We propose that Raider, as their real world counterparts, __came from northern regions, which allowed them to survive Lord Vanaduke's campaign from the mountains__ and _then come back to now ashen land of kingdom of Almire_ once they were defeated on the mainland.

Considering many potential parallels and inspirations behind this setting we suggest that an approximate relation between kingdoms follows a pattern:

- Kingdom of Almire with a celtic background and a deific alliance with goddess of nature, spirits, and water, Spirit Mother.
- Spiral Raiders are pagans, as pre-Christianized vikings, yet preserving the culture and symbols of Spiral Order, they possess an established land -- a kingdom on the mainland and settlements overseas.
- Kingdom of Ironmight, being a primarily trading state as its heraldy, stars and crowns, are used as Cradle's currency symbols by the time Skylark had crash landed.


##### Concept of Firestorm

The [Firestorm Raider Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Helm#Firestorm_Raider_Helm) is described as `a pristine raider helmet, save for a few dings and a thick coat of ash`. It introduces an event, which implies a connection with:

- Volcanic activity, therefore ash
- Firestorm Citadel and Lord Vanaduke's supernaturl power over fires.

We suggest that this gear became such after fall of Almire as it burned. A possibility of continuous raids on the Citadel may be found both through implication of that gear's state as well as Lord Vanaduke's initial reaction on knight's presence at Citadel's throne room: `What's this? More wolves hungry for the blood of Almire? Our great kingdom shall never fall to the likes of beasts!` ([Firestorm Citadel - Throne Room - Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Throne_Room)).

Raiders did came from cold regions as seen by overall design. And _based on the significance of the context behind firestorm,_ __its usage here is meant to be associated with Firestorm Citadel__.

Moreover, given [Frenzied Firestorm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzied_Firestorm#Frenzied_Firestorm) Drakon ability upgrade, this concept of a firestorm and character of being frenzy may be more fundamental, than the adjective itself at Citadel's name: `All that remains is a great citadel that seems to be engulfed in never-ending flames that Spiral HQ has been calling the 'Firestorm Citadel'. From what we can tell, the whole place is swarming with undead and built like a fortress` ([Eye of the Needle - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle)), as it is related to dragons to characterize one of their aspects, resembling a storm of fire.

As Kora states that the Spiral HQ called the location the Firestorm Citadel, we can propose that concept of firestorm is of Isoran origin or at least is adopted by them.

The fact that modern Spiral Order had given the Citadel such name, paralleling raiders' naming convention, if the raiders did come from Isoran past, seems us another link, which connects the two civilizations as being Isoran in their separated by time existence.

Lost Souls also refer to the Citadel as such: `You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great Kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice` ([King of Ashes - Blackstone Bridge - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Blackstone_Bridge))). We consider those Lost Souls being also people of Almire due to their presence within the Citadel and hinted benevolent motives, shared between all Almirian Souls. As those souls are likely Almirians, we can explain their coincidental usage of the same term in relation to the citadel as canon.

##### Caladbolg and Irish Mythology

There are a few items within [Lucky Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lucky_Prize_Box) with an established narrative with tap into Irish Mythology.

Major element of Almire's culture is based on its relation to water and Spirit Mother. As we commit to a chronology where Spiral Raiders exist in the same time period as Almire and Ironmight kingdoms, we suggest a potential relation to Irish kingdoms.

As it was pointed out earlier, raiders seem to belong to pagans, mainly due to their equipment with motifs from Norse mythology. It may be plausible for this instance of paganism being the alignment to ancient concepts of spiral and energy.

As on the contrary, kingdom of Almire is aligned with the Spirit Mother. This concept of a connection can be vaguely seen in the _Tuatha Dé Danann civilization of Irish mythology_. Tuatha Dé Danann were a race of divine beings and among them was the goddess Danu, who was __associated with nature, fertility, earth and water__, similar to Nature Sprites being `the rain, the root, and the soil`. Danu also represents the _fertile ground from which life springs emerge_ and is _associated with rivers and flowing water_. This connection is seen in natural motif and designs of Almirian furniture, as well as in the water fountains of Almire, whose water was taken from the Spirit Mother's Realm, capable of negating the curse set by cursed Lord Vanaduke.

A possible connection to Irish Mythology may be established also through items of Lucky Prize Box, specifically [Pot O' Crowns](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pot_O%27_Crowns) and [Caladbolg](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Caladbolg), both dealing elemental fire damage. The latter item, the sword, accroding to Irish mythology -- the `Ulster Cycle` in particular, -- Caladbolg belongs to a king of Ulster. Another name for this kingdom is Ulaid, one of five and later four kingdoms of Ireland.

<!--We may suggest a far less actualized connection of an aforementioned narrative of 3 kingdoms through inspiration from _Anglo-Norman conquest of Ireland_. The act of 2 kingdoms invading Almire may be seen as similar to invasion of Ireland in a particular event: deposed by High King of Ireland king of Leinster, Dermot MacMurrough, sought assistance of England in order to reclaim his throne, which had marked the beginning of acual invasion of Ireland.

As it recontextualized the narrative in a way which frames the 2 invading kingdoms as a foreign force to Ireland as Lord Vanaduke's army of fiends to material realm, rather than internal to Ireland events involving High King of Ireland, we will conclude this a false lead.-->

Given mediaval origin of that gear, similar to ancient plate set, we will propose that at present moment items of Lucky Prize Box relate to the same period of time when kingdom of Almire had prospered.

##### Giant Sword

Another element of similar design is located in the Wolver Den, a [scenario room with a giant sword stuck in stone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Wolver_Den_2.png).

The sword is said to have a __star map engraved on it__, reminding us of Isoran celestial sets.

There are 2 elements to sword's design:

- The sword is larger than any weapon so far discovered
- The sword has a map of stars: `Etched within the side of the blade appears to be some kind of map of the stars`.

The only connection we can derive from it, given sword's size and connection to the stars is the _myth of Asgard's construction with the assistance of Giants_. The Sword of Freyr comes us to mind, as it was given up in marriage of Freyr with a giantess Gerðr. This universe's Asgard, as noted earlier, is the heavenly kingdom of Valkyries.

If we attempt to extrapolate this myth or merging of 2 myths, it would seem to us as follows.

The sword was made by Valkyries to assist titans -- Tortomega -- in their own work. The sword was sent from the heavenly kingdom and stuck in a rock, located in [fractured region we have theorized to be the veiled homeland](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland), now identified as Wolver Den, given similar architecture. The sword was never used as it was likely too late for titans, as [Undercorp had deployed dark matter-powered tortodrones](#the-titans-tortomega-the-fall).

Among all existing species, we suggest it is only Tortomega who are capable of weilding a sword of that scale at a location closely associated with their architecture.

While stars are not commonly associated with Valkyries nor heavenly kingdom, we may think of Valkyries as Isorans, but currently, we are unable to present an explanation to the meaning of stars on the sword other than an elaboration of the true nature of heavenly kingom, higher realm or paradise (`A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` - [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen)) itself as a descrete, celestial location or realm.

So far we have proposed a scenario of Isorans being stranded on a planet, which was at some point incorporated into Cradle. Such case seems to us relatively plausible also due to the fact that presence of Clockworks should then be recorder by, at least, people of Almire -- based on the position of Haven, Clockwork tunnels are not particularly deep below the ground, which should've been recounted.

In this regard only Valkyries remain as the only species possessing a history with Underworld and only Tortomega capable of weilding this sword.

<!--##### Location of Firestorm Citadel

Under this notion of relying on Norse and Irish mythology, we can attempt to establish the location of the Firestorm Citadel based on the proximity to the potentially volcanic mountains, while looking at presence of several kingdoms and Vikings being involved into the conflict.

Among few medieval Irish castles, we consider Firestorm Citadel being potentially inspired by the Rock of Cashel, located in the city of Cashel in Kingdom of Munster near the Galtee Mountains. Kingdom was invaded by Uí Imair's army of pagan Vikings. Near it a certain mountain is located - Devil's Bit.

According to the legend, the devil broke his teeth and spat the Rock of Cashel from his mouth to where it stands. The concept of a deity or a beast giving its fang or tooth, then for it being used is common, even of making it into a weapon, this concept is found across many myths.

Here we think of dragons' teeth in the context of western european legends, where teeth would hold symbolic meaning as well as being powerful artifacts.

While this proposal does not completely suffice the setting of Almire, as the themes, found in relation to Devil's Bit does not seem to parallel ours,

The general motif of broken teeth and devil is also found here as the [Fang of Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog), `a sword said to be created from the fang of the fire beast, Vog`.

As it is alchemized from Almirian Seals, it might suggest its involvement with Lord Vanaduke, albeit the same Ancient Armor does not belong to this period of time despite being acquired for Almirian Seals, as we have discussed earlier. Yet, the sword contains Vog's supposed idea of him both granting power through fire as well as that same fire being detrimental even.

Due to this we suggest __Vog being framed as a symbolic dragon perceived by the kingdom of Almire__ though accompanying it motifs. We will see further that presence of Vog in this period of time might be [deeper](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity) than the mountain shrine alone Lord Vanaduke will find.

As Ancient Plate set is transmuted for Almirian Seals, it remains a matter of further discussion, whether it may belong to Titans, as most of Brinks' gear is seemingly associated with corresponding boss figures.

As the citadle Lord Vanaduke was located was referred as the `Grand Citadel`, we would suggest that this is the capital of kingdom of Almire, a castle, a palace and a fortress.-->

#### King in The Mountain

As we approach the analysis of Lord Vanaduke himself, we should point out a trope of [`king in the mountain`](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain) -- a king being considered gone and then returning in a time of kingdom's most need.

In the case of kingdom of Almire the ending of this narrative is [subverted](https://www.medievalists.net/2022/09/kings-mountain-myths-germany-byzantium/) as Lord Vanaduke when he had returned became the reason for Almire's fall and fall of nearby invading kingdoms, followed by a _rapid spread of curse and undeath_.

As `Almire's Fall` had described events from, generally, Lord Vanaduke's perspective, as the narratiion was focusing onhim and the events which had happened in the mountains, we also have accounts of his return in greater detail, rather than statement of fcat of him returnung with a fiendish army and burning down the land: `In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains` (`Almire's Fall`):

<!--As Lord Vanaduke had searched the mountains, we relate back to 2 concepts:

- `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain` ([Avenger's Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Avenger_Helm#Storm_Avenger_Helm)).
- `A helm worn by members of the Scarlet Scouts. Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` ([Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm)).-->

- `Lord Vanaduke brought the fire from the mountains to our kingdom. Everything burned. His enemies. Even his family. My family was lost too. I fled the battle as soon as I saw the wave of flames in the distance. I was able to reach my home just in time to see it burn. I don't even remember how it ended. I have no memory of my passing` ([Nameless Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue)).
- `Like so many of its people, Law and Order have fled Almire. Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke. Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless. My position has afforded me much in my life. I used to love the view that my tower offers. From these lofty heights I thought of myself as the first one to greet the spring season, the first to smell the life in the air as the flowers bloomed. Now only death and smoke hang in the air, even from these great heights. And the fires; the unnatural fires that seem to burn eternal, the fires that turn even the most pious men into horrible nightmares, I know that these fires shall soon take me as well. I will not give my former Lord the gift of my own life. It is not his to take, to twist. This shall be my final order. This shall be my Justice` ([Legion of Almire - Inner Sanctum - Almirian Codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_codex_text_Dialogue/Inner_Sanctum)).
- `This is a real place, some kind of shell of a former empire. There is great sorrow here, something unlike anything I have felt before. Legions of shambling dead have attacked us here, relentless in their defense of this place. Their broken, burnt frames crumbling and rising once more, ready for another battle. And just as they refuse to fall, so does the burning ruin around them. It is almost as if this whole realm is trapped in a single moment from some forgotten time, never changing, never allowing itself to finally turn to ash. You can feel it in the smoldering air - an eternal will holding this place together, never allowing its inhabitants to rest. No creature deserves such a fate, it is beyond my understanding` (Recon Module: Firestorm Citadel - Grantz)

This establishes a general timeline of events. Lord Vanaduke fled into the mountains, there he spent _years_: `He tirelessly searched the mountains for many years, no longer the man he was before, but a mad hermit` ([`Almire's Fall`](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263)). It is unknown weather Almire at that point had fallen under control of invading kingdoms, as the aforementioned recounts of those events do not conatin this information.

[Almirian Codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_codex_text_Dialogue/Inner_Sanctum) notes on people of Almire fleeing as `Like so many of its people, Law and Order have fled Almire` as well as `I fled the battle as soon as I saw the wave of flames in the distance` which make it ambigious, whether:

- Shrinking population, lack of law and order, and ongoing battle are consequences of Almire being ruled by an alliance of invading of kingdoms or struggling at war years after Lord Vanaduke had fled, or;
- Those are being direct result of Lord Vanaduke's return announced by a `wall of fire`, as those virtues are juxtaposed to `Justice`, which had remained, albeit morally degraded by presence of curse -- `Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke. Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless`.

  Through this account we can identify Lord Vanaduke's mace he uses during the fight at Grand Citadel's throne room as his `burning scepter` -- `Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke`.

Through those texts we can identify properties of shadow fire:

- Supernatural nature of fire allows it to burn eternally, `unnatural fires that seem to burn eternal` ([Legion of Almire - Inner Sanctum - Almirian Codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_codex_text_Dialogue/Inner_Sanctum)), as evident by the state Firestorm Citadel is found more than 1000 years after Almire's Fall
- Due to supernatural nature of fire it can only be extinguished with divine water from Spirit Mother's relam, specifically from spirit wells: `The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself` ([Firestorm Citadel - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite)).
- Supernatural nature of fire transforms the physical apperance: `the fires that turn even the most pious men into horrible nightmares` ([Legion of Almire - Inner Sanctum - Almirian Codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_codex_text_Dialogue/Inner_Sanctum)), which we proposed to be soul's aura.
- Fire does not burn the soul, but traps it:
  - `I will not give my former Lord the gift of my own life. It is not his to take, to twist` ([Legion of Almire - Inner Sanctum - Almirian Codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_codex_text_Dialogue/Inner_Sanctum)).
  - `There the cursed king has remained since, in an ashen throne of a burning kingdom, surrounded by all the lost souls of the people that once served him` (Almire's Fall).

Meanwhile in the mountains, Lord Vanaduke found a shrine to an unknown deity. It was located in a chamber, whose floor was of ash and burning coals: `Within it he discovered a great chamber whose floor was waist deep in ashes. They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable` (Almire's Fall).

This property of shrine's chamber design, with ash and coals present, of course, relates to fire. But it is unknown whether the mountain itself is a volcano or the unnatural warmth is delegated to only this chamber. As Lord Vanaduke was last described being in the shrine, and as it is recounted by citizens of Almire that fires began to erupt from the mountains, yet it is unknown thether the shrine itself was the source of the fires.

Yet we can identify the shrine as the __location from which Lord Vanaduke's fiendish army had emerged__ -- _the ashen floor leading to the source of that army below_: `With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder` (Almire's Fall).

The wall of flames described to come with Lord Vanaduke suggests magic similar to _fire snakes being cast during the fight_. SHadow fire was capable of transformation -- that seems to be the case of a burning undead across the Necropolis. Those undead are ones already discussed in the [crypts and undeath section](#crypts-and-undeath):

- [Slag Walker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Slag_Walker)
- [Carnavon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Carnavon)
- [Almirian Shadow Guard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Shadow_Guard#Almirian_Shadow_Guard)
- [Almirian Crusaders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader)

Everyone, apart from Slag Walkers which posses an armor, are related to the curse either through their appearance or ability to inflict it onto others.

Yet, they are not the original army of so called fiends, which are stated in the text of Almire's Fall to come with the king and return to the mountains -- `With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder` (Almire's Fall), -- suggesting that this other army came from the shrine and differs from the ones tranformed by fire.

##### Blackened Shrine and Magma Deity

Before covering Lord Vanaduke's fiendish army, we will analyze the shrine within the mountains. We will refer to it as the _Blackened Shrine_ based on the text of `Almire's Fall`: `They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable`.

We have a candidate, one fitting both with fiery and curse themes of the deity of the shrine -- the unnamed magma god, referred by the magma fanatics, first introduced in the [fiendish cults](#fiendish-cults). It is seen by their design and description: `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail)). The phrase `Its fires will protect those that are worthy` seem similar to `...this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` ([Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm)) as the motif of worth:

- `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain` ([Avenger's Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Avenger_Helm#Storm_Avenger_Helm)).
- `A helm worn by members of the Scarlet Scouts. Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` ([Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm)).

As [Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail) refers in _omnious manner to worth and fire_, so Lord Vanaduke and the rest of the legions of Almire were cursed by the flames.

Through those flames _they were granted cursed immortality_, as well as, eventually, resulting in Almire defeating other kingdoms, although in a subverted, cursed and undead state: `Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day` (Almire's Fall).

Spiral HQ has its own note on the deity behind [Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail) -- `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy`, as: `Even more fun: by burning things while taking on the visage of a fiery deity of martial prowess` [Fire GOOD!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111013).

It is unknown, how Spiral Order had regained this knowledge, but, based on the earlier discussed [Operation Gelid](#operation-gelid), we can suggest that this case might be of similar nature, tracing back to expanding understanding of Underworld by Spiral Order or of Spiral HQ being compromised by an actor from Underworld.

The roster of items describes an entity, a suggested fanatic, who seems to possess a portion of this deity's power:

- `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail)).
- `A mask said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will light the path to victory` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mask#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mask)). Given `visage of a fiery deity of martial prowess` ([Fire GOOD!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111013)), we can identify this mask as similar to _actual face of the magma deity_.
- [Magmatic Fanatic Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Wings)
- [Magmatic Shackles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Shackles#Magmatic_Shackles)

The design of fanatics' gear is reminiscent of celestial gear of ancient Isorans, but currently we can consider it only as a coincidence, as well as with addition of wings -- of Apocrean Disciples.

As the fanatic gear bears similar motif of a connection to Underworld, as Arctic gear to Apocrea, as it bears similar to shadow fire of Almire motifs, we propose that there is only one `fiery deity` which is inherently related to Underworld, which makes itself present in the material realm, and whose presence Spirit Mother was suppressing from her realm, __Vog__.

##### Vog, the Fire Beast-Deity of Underworld

[Fang of Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog), `a sword said to be created from the fang of the fire beast, Vog`, presents the most direct acknowledgement of existence of Vog and its identity as the `fire beast`.

We think of dragons' teeth in the context of western european legends, where teeth would hold symbolic meaning as well as being powerful artifacts. The general motif of broken teeth is found in the [Fang of Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog), `a sword said to be created from the fang of the fire beast, Vog`, which frames Vog as a beast. Yet, it remains a _powerfull sentient deity with not explicitly malevelent, but cruel motivations_, onto which we have [elaborated previously](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity) as the source of shadow fire's nature.

As Fang of Vog is alchemized from Almirian Seals, it suggests its involvement with Almire. The crual nature of that fire is reflected in sword's debuff of a chance to inflict fire onto the weilder, __mirroring the subversion of Lord Vanaduke's fulfilled wish to reclaim his kingdom__.

Presence of Vog is not restricted to Almire's narrative as [fiendish cults](#fiendish-cults) continue to exist, the Blackened Shrine was carved in the mountain before kingdom of Almire was invaded. we propose _magmatic fanatics relating to the Magma Deity, and here we can propose that this deity's name is Vog_.

It was established that Vog is not a wolver  -- `The great fire beast Vog. The great fire beast Vog isn't a wolver himself, but a fiery deity of sorts who embraces some creatures and grants them a bit of power. Vog's 'cubs' are more or less acquired and forced to spread his fiery love across the world` ([Nick Popovich](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776)), -- yet the effects of this deity's power affect all living entities in the similar manner:

- Lord Vanaduke's transformation
- [magmatic fanatics](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail)
- [Vog cubs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub#Vog_Cub), and the equipment made of the latter, [Vog Cub Set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub_Coat)
- Legions of Almire:
  - [Slag Walker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Slag_Walker)
  - [Carnavon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Carnavon)
  - [Almirian Shadow Guard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Shadow_Guard#Almirian_Shadow_Guard)
  - [Almirian Crusaders](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader)
- On smaller note [Vog slippers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Vog_Slippers-Equipped.png) of the [Cozy Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box) depict vog cubs as fire-themed wolvers with glowing muzzle and burning tail, preserving this motif of burning.

Those instances possess a distinct design, _identical to manifestations of Vog's influence_.

Lord Vanaduke resembles a fiery giant, while the rest of Almirians -- Crusaders, Carnavons, and to a degree Royal Guards, -- are much less smaller in their stature by magnitudes. The case of guards being far larger than any Isoran will be explored further in the analysis of [Undead Dreadnoughts](#undead-dreadnoughts).

Then there are vog cubs. There are no present sources of their resemblance, but, as based on the equipment, made from their hides -- the [Vog Cub set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub_Coat), -- they seem to also possess same volcanic characteristics, as _this set possesses identical blazing cracked pattern_. The Vog Cub set being an upgrade of [Ash Tail set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_Tail_Coat) also _allows us to draw parallels with_ [frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma_Frostifur#Frostifur) and [Perma-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma_Frostifur#Perma-Frostifur) _as both in differing capacity seem to align to the Hail Deity_, as discuss in the [influences of Underworld](#influences-of-underworld).

<!--It is important to note that the heavenly kingdom is located above magma-covered mountains: `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain` ([Raging Avenger Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Avenger_Helm)). Does this mean that the mountain in question is the same one the blackened shrine is located?-->

As we had commited to an idea of Valkyries of heavenly kingdom existing prior to Tortomega, they would exist during medieval age of kingdoms. Yet, according to this interpretaion Valkyries had not interveneed with Undercorp seizing Tortomega, nor fiends accompanying Lord Vanaduke.

Throughout Almire's war with neighboring kingdoms, Valkyries of heavenly kingdom had remained uninvolved, given lack of any their presence. They did not intervene with the war, but, we suggest that at some point with the introduction of fiendish magi, potentially through Lord Vanaduke's fiendish legon, they had to take measures. We propose those measures eventually resulted in the _banishment of Legion of Ur into the Underworld_.

<!--We can reason why valkyries haven't intervene, as in case of Undercorp's erasure of Titans, and a plausible explanation could be one where events of this chapter had happened on a remote planet, separate from heavenly kingdom. But, there is existence of Owlites, who had inherited valkyrian divine magic and studied the kingdom of Almire.-->

##### Nature of the Mountain

We now return to the nature of the mountain itself which houses the Blackened Shrine. By following thematic parallels, we propose that this is a volcano with a supernatural elemnt of souls and access to Underworld found in its depth:

- Presence of volcanic armor, supposedly manufactured by kingdom of Ironmight, utilizes volcanic iron as well as fiery souls. We have discussed that both concept are not of material realm, by concept of souls.
- `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail)).
- `A mask said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will light the path to victory` ([Magmatic Fanatic Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mask#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mask))
- Inner Sanctum of Legion of Almire is most reminiscent of excavated remains of the _city of Pompeii_ which had fallen to a volcano.

Through those narratives presence of Blackened Shrine may be seen as natural extension of cultists' plot, as a scared location bearing image of a deity.

Aforementioned relation to fire deity and ashen remains of legions of Almire may bring up a potential inspiration behind Vog -- a concept of volcanic deity, specifically, roman god Vulcan. Vulcan is also associated with metalwork, which can be found in volcanic plate armor and a faction forging this armor with the knowledge of spiritual, supernatural nature of elements, fire in particular.

<!--Apart from Vulcan, coupled with motif of nature for Almire and shrine in the mountains, a potential inspiration may be seen in Fujisan Sengen Shrine located in the foothills of Mount Fuji, Japan.-->

<!--Not only it is located in the volcanic mountain, enshrining Kamuatatsu-hime - goddess of water keeping volcano from erupting, and is associated with water springs. Both volcan and water themes are present in Almire, as well as fit into a potential geography of Almire, being located in the foothills with water springs from the mountain, given how Lord Vanaduke had resorted to this myth in the mountains.-->

As the narrative of Almire's Fall suggests that the legend of a shrine was sparse to the point of _being considered a superstition_, we can attribute its creation to a civilization existing before Almire: `...he fled from the citadel and vanished into the mountains, vowing that he would one day reclaim his throne. Leaving behind his family, his people and his homeland, Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths. He tirelessly searched the mountains for many years, no longer the man he was before, but a mad hermit. Then one day he discovered a small cave...` (Almire's Fall), which had to be aware of the supernatural nature of the deiry and greater cosmology.

As we have covered Underworld and Undercorp, we suggest that this civilization may have possessed a connection with Underworld through symbolism of faces within their designs -- as [monster gates](#monster-doors-security-flaw-of-clockworks) and [grim totems](#grim-totems-part-1), -- with an inherent, low-tech, occult property.

While it is a speculation, existence of a builder civilization which itself is aware of Vog offers an opportunity for a time period and therefore history prior even to existence of kngdom of Almire with greater focus on the occult and more explicit presence of magic.

<!--This concept of a deity or a guardian is similar to Isoran myth of an Oni in the mountains: `Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` ([Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm)). This seems to us a very strong parallel to the perceived through retellings legend, due to which Lord Vanaduke departed into the mountains in the first place: `Going mad from the pressure, he fled from the citadel and vanished into the mountains, vowing that he would one day reclaim his throne. Leaving behind his family, his people, and his homeland, Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths. He tirelessly searched the mountains for many years, no longer the man he was before, but a mad hermit` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).-->

<!--It seems plausible to us that Almire, while it held power over land, and as it developed, __it unearthed the volcanic iron and flame souls deep in the mountains__. And, by being a medieval kingdom, one potentially aware of other realms, at least of Spirit Mother's realm, it is _plausible for it eventually to discover Underworld in the generally similar manner as Tortomega once did_.-->

<!--Through those discoveries, kept within the mountain, armor was made, forged from the volcanic iron. And, at the same time a __connection with Vog was established in the mountain, which can explain presence of both Blackened Shrine and Magma Fanatics__.-->

##### Discovery of Vile Deity

We can also suggest that near this time an unknown Vile fiendish entity was found, as seen in [Venom Fiend Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Fiend_Mask#Venom_Fiend_Mask): `A mask said to be crafted in the visage of a venomous fiend. It is infused with a vile essence that is sure to frighten your foes`, and its similarity to the Magma Deity.

As Nature Sprites possess crude application of color, so are poison themed zombies -- wich evokes the same primal theme as Underworld prior to Undercorp.

<!--While being mainly a speculation, it proposes an explanation for this similarity as follows: _as Almire was at war, it can be plausible for the people of Almire to search for far more drastic measures_, paralleling Lord Vanaduke's search, and, as discussed in the [graveyards section](#graveyards), eventually someone would attempt to tap into the occult from those means. A contact with the Underworld would be established, discovering the Vile Deity, manifested in presence of green essence occasionally leaking from the tombstones.-->

<!--This seems more possible if we take in consideration that _Lord Vanaduke had originally sought after the mountains due to a legend or a tale_: `Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).-->

The graveyards are present as the [necropolis grounds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds) where Almirian army was buried and contain [Almirian tombs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_1.png), resulting in an idea of [graveyard architecture being Almirian](#almirian-architecture).

Both the necropolis and tombs we can find lingering, seemingly devilite activity, specifically, at the necropolis -- Devilite sigils are present near the tombs in the final arena of the [Necropolis Grounds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds).

But as for whoever was drawing the sigils, we do not know. A potential lead in that regard, but one that seems more of an asset reuse -- is presence of devilite sigil-like patterns on the Water Fountain in the court of the Firestorm Citadel.

Those factors, we suggest, point at presence or influence of Underworld onto Almire and material realm in that region prior to establishment of those kingdom, reaching the time Undercorp had invaded material realm through Tortomega, as currently the most ancient terrestrial civiliztion.

#### Legion of Ur

It is stated that Lord Vanaduke had returned from the mountains with a fiendish army: `Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

__The one army that is deeply connected to Underworld and made up of fiends is the Legion of Ur__. Moreover, we find trojans across the Firestorm Citadel. Yet, how do they fit to the established timeline? There are connection to Almire, [but even more to Spiral Order]() represented as a _parallel and similarity between a trojan and a Spiral Warden_.

Did Spiral Order took Legion of Ur as an inspiration for Spiral Wardens or whether trojans are Spiral Wardens?

This was state [we left off the analysis of Spiral Wardens](#spiral-wardens) in their similarity to trojans through acknowledgement of corruption -- `...get distinctive Spiral Warden horse head costume items in Colossal Prize Boxes! (Or if you want a touch of corruption in your life and you'd rather look like a Trojan, you can do that too*)` ([Onward to the Year of the Horse!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95960)), -- existence of [Baleful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Baleful_Aura#Baleful_Aura) and, most importantly, [Prismatic Ruinous Crystal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Ruinous_Crystal).

In previous section [we concluded](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity) that fire beast-deity Vog is the Magma Deity accompanied by cults and a civilization preceeding Almire and other kingdoms, inhabiting the grounds of the mountain, where the [Blackened Shrine](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity) was built. Then we proposed that the act of fire erupting from the mountains heralding Lord Vanaduke's return was connected to volcanic nature of the mountain, while the arrival and a departure of Lord Vanaduke's legion into the mountains implied a physical connection to Underworld.

Now Legion of Ur remains sealed in the Underworld -- `Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion or Ur', and are said to have once numbered in the thousands. Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back` ([The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)).

Then [Crest of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crests_of_Ur) reveals that the legion might not be originally native to Underworld, or at least its presence was not established prior to the conquest, `A crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves`, which further solidifies manpower of the trojan legion.

##### Almirian Empire

Setting aside designs of curse within Vanaduke, Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, and nature of dark matter within trojans, we should point out the following arrangement of concepts -- _spookats and zombies do belong to different epochs separated by thousand of years_. And yet, both zombies and spookats are present across Owlite Academy, which is part of heavenly kingdom.

We speculate that at some point in time Lord Vanaduke had a military conflict with heavenly kingdom, wherein Owlites and Valkyries were present.

This speculation is derived from specific words in the monster codex, wherein Lord Vanaduke is characterised as _eternal_ and his kingdom -- _Almirian Empire_: `Little is known about the eternal Duke of the Almirian Empire` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke#About)).

Similar characteristic is given by Grantz: `This is a real place, some kind of shell of a former empire. There is great sorrow here, something unlike anything I have felt before. Legions of shambling dead have attacked us here, relentless in their defense of this place. Their broken, burnt frames crumbling and rising once more, ready for another battle. And just as they refuse to fall, so does the burning ruin around them. It is almost as if this whole realm is trapped in a single moment from some forgotten time, never changing, never allowing itself to finally turn to ash. You can feel it in the smoldering air- an eternal will holding this place together, never allowing its inhabitants to rest. No creature deserves such a fate, it is beyond my understanding` (Recon Module: Firestorm Citadel - Grantz)

Could it be that the kingdom of Almire did become an empire the size of the 3 warring kingdoms after Lord Vanaduke destroyed their armies -- `Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash` (Almire's Fall)?

Yet it is states that Lord Vanaduke had returned to the citadel: `With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him. There the cursed king has remained since, ruling a burning kingdom from an ashen throne` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

This characteristic of an empire, we propose, was given not to a living kingdom of Almire defined by its relation to nature, but to its state after Lord Vanaduke's return. This interpretaion allows for an empire to be defined as the __undead, cursed total of 3 burnt kingdoms held together by Lord Vanaduke's will__.

Those recounts also establish a _narrative of unprecedented manpower of the accompanied trojan legion of fiends_, allowing them to be characterized as a _decisive weapon_ and __single most powerful army of the Underworld__, [reminiscent of Uncdercorp's army of tortodrones](#the-titans-tortomega-the-fall).

##### Trojans

We should determine whether trojans are Isoran Spiral Wardens. How the similarity of their roles -- of __trojans being an elite force of Underworld__, and __Wardens being guardians of the Order__ through the Guardian's Oath, -- defines them in relation to each other?

Trojans of tier 2 and tier 3 possess revealed bones, most visible at their skulls, which are horse skulls.

<!--with the lower jaw similar to apparitions of giant wolvers of charged [Wild Hunting Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Hunting_Blade), [Perma-Frostifurs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur), and [Void Wolvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Void_Wolver).-->

The undead direction manifests most distinctly in tier 3 trojans, whose armor has depictions of skulls while covering exposed ribcage burning with purple flames. The stone exterior which was previously a depition of horse head had shattered, fully revealing a fully-formed horse skull.

<!--It is said that some devilites tend to transform into gorgos: `Gorgos are bulbous fiends who are constantly on the lookout for their next meal. Within the Underworld they are among the lowest in the fiendish pecking order and are used as a twisted form of motivation for white collar devilites. For those that don't work hard every day will eventually become a terrible gorgo; their bodies bloating and their two eyes forming into one, because why waste all that extra energy blinking both?` ([Release Notes: 2013.05.01](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-05-01)). Herein also exists Lord Vanaduke by the fact of him being transformed, although by a curse, into an immortal fiery giant of different physiology.-->

<!--As a matter of fact, significant transformation while is rare, exists, evident by Lord Vanaduke and Maulos.-->

Tier 1 trojans and the rest are explicitly seen as stone statues. In fact, trojans are encountered for the first time as [statues in the final room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:BOTF.png) of [Soldier's Graveyard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen/Soldier%27s_Graveyard) during [Blades of The Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen), `... dark energies resonate from the graveyard, attracted to the countless souls it houses`.

Another instance of trojans being depicted as statues is at the [Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cryptic_Statuary), a castle, reminiscent both of Scarlet Fortress and Royal Jelly Palace with later's architecture incorporating water basins into the courtyards while being located outside of the main landmass of Scarlet Fortress, yet bearing Scarlet Fortress tapestry.

Across all tiers, trojans have dark matter mineral embedded into their backs, and as depth increases, so its presence being more intense and distinct.

<!--Notably, Tier 1 trojans have wooden armor, and considering there is existence of ironwood fantasy-themed application, we can suggest that it is redwood, due to its color.-->

<!--The crest of their shields present on tier 1 trojans may potentially refer to Ironmight crest, mainly based on the idea that a tower depicted on all Scarlet Fortress tapestries is emblem of Heavenly Kingdom.-->

<!--There is a vague notion of [chess-themed hierarchy found across all of the species](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chess_Mini), designed to fit into the [Guild Hall](#guild-hall-and-spiral-order-headquarters).-->

Then there is burning, while the color is a hue of purple or pink, there are other instances of that type of burning being observed. Those are Carnavons, Darkfire Lord Vanaduke and the [Dark Embers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember), which are `salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room` ([Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)), and purple orbs of fire in suspended bowls across Moorcroft Manor and Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

So far there areseveral notions attributed to trojans:

- They represent both the most powerful army of Underworld, potentially not native to it, and most powerful units of Spiral Order.
- They possess a motif of petrification and stone, bones and burning
- Presence of embedded mineral grants them occult nature.
- They were at some point conqerors of Underworld, they were sealed in the Underworld, and their presence in the material relam is devastating to the latter.

They are similar to dark matter-ridden tortodrones:

- They possess petrified external and mineral-related interior, a general relation to stone as representative of power and might.
- Similar to tortodrones, there is distinct burning: for tortodrones its their eyes, and for trojasn, their ribcage and skull.
- Animalistic anatomy, unknown or seemingly artificial nature of their origin.
- Both throjans and tortodrones may be seen as corrupted to a certain extent, through exposure to dark matter.

Within the narrative of industrialization of Underworld, __trojans may be seen an iteration of a petrified, dark matter-powered army in the age of ritual circles prior to Undercorp-controlled, technologically advanced army of tortodrones__.

##### Arkus and the Silent Legion

With this context and perception of trojans, we will cover [Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus), as a _single Isoran_, who __bridges the symbolic gap between a trojan and a Spiral Warden__.

Arkus is the only one surviving memebr of his squad after an attack of dust zombies: `Arkus's own squad perished in a grisly battle with a horde of dust zombies. Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad` ([The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion)). This event had led Arkus into the Statuary, `I am drawn to this place. ... I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do. Their faces, their dying cries... they haunted me in my dreams, so I no longer sleep. Now I see them when I close my eyes, so I shall not blink. I will remain here, among the stones... never blinking, never forgetting` ([Recon Module: Cryptic Statuary - Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)), we can attempt to further analyze the state he is found in through different means.

The mission card depicts trojans while they are encased in stone. Given the 3rd depth of the mission, Cryptic Statuary, it may be the location meant to be found seen at the mission card.

This establishes as _connection between trojan Legion of Ur_ and the _Silent Legion of stone trojans_. The distinction here, we believe, stems from the fact that Legion of Ur is active to this day, despite being sealed in the Underworld, while the Silent Legion of trojans is present in the material realm, encased in stone. And yet, once they are revealed from stone, they are indistinguishable from members of the throjan legion.

We do not know their motivation at this point, but few potential hints may be found -- some statues at the Cryptic Statuary are concealed trojans, while trojans, once defeated, turn to stone, -- which may reveal their nature and origin through _a common pattern of association with statues_.

The symbolic value of trojan statues may be derived from a potential, real-world inspiraion -- of the `Terracotta Army`, -- meant to accompany its master after their departure. This relation _may provide further identification of Ur as an entity not native to Underworld, but one who would eventually lead the army to conquer Underworld_.

###### `Poisoned Minds` and `Cold Hearts`

First and second depths of [The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion) are `Poisoned Minds` and `Cold Hearts`.

This seems to us as most prominent symbolism in regards to the Silent Legion within Spiral Knights cosmology. If we were to interpret those titles by focusing on attribution to multiple entities and their minds and hearts, with a high certainty we would attribute them to the members of the Silent Legio -- trojans.

`Cold hearts` can be interpreted as unfeeling or uncaring, "cold-hearted". Trojans are turned to stone at that point, so it could be a metaphor for stone, both as stone cold and relentless in their goals.

The `poisoned minds` are more nuanced, it is not a singular mind, which in that case would be Arkus, but _it refers to an entire legion_. At that, as Arkus is meant to resemble a trojan, does this state of poisoned mind also is relelvant for Arkus? What is the reason for this condition?

Considering presence of devilites across Cradle, how they were found in the [Gauntlet during Shock and Awe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet#Gate_Map), as well as at the [penultimate arena during Gauntlet's Last Stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand), could it be that devilites are involved in the creation of the Legion?

Considering that there is no other party powerful or skilled enough to perform such rituals or operations in relation to curses, dark matter, or haunting, we propose that _devilites are primary candidates responsible for the creation of the Legion of Ur_. More so, the prior similarities between trojans and tortodrones may suggest a common goal in their creation, or a common metaphysical principal of their creation, while similarity between trojans and Spiral Warden may indeed be intentional.

While there are less connections to specifics of devilite or trojan goals, fiendish physiology of trojans may be analyzed to a greater extent as it is depicted.

[Crest of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Ur) is described as `a crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves`.

The same phenomenon of drums was mentioned during Almire's Fall for Lord Vanaduke: `The image burned into his eyes and brain like cinders, and contained that which sounded like the screaming of foreign tongues and war drums` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

While we have noted on the similarities of those events, presence of drums, we propose, links the two separated by time events over a potential, _characteristic presence of Underworld_, rendering trojans a result of a ritual performed, most plausibly, on Spiral Wardens, given their __acknowledgement of the Ruinous Crystal and corruption__, wherein Ruinous Crystal, as mentioned at the [introducion of the Wardens](#spiral-wardens), can be seen if not as the catalyst for Warden's corruption, at least as a solid link to its fiendish nature.

##### Haunting

What happened to Arkus by the time Spiral Knights had met him? For that we have to analyze Arkus himself and his monologue:

- `I am drawn to this place. In the eyes of these silent warriors I see myself: cold, strong, unflinching... and crumbling. I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do. Their faces, their dying cries... they haunted me in my dreams, so I no longer sleep. Now I see them when I close my eyes, so I shall not blink. I will remain here, among the stones... never blinking, never forgetting` ([Arkus - Recon Module: Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus#Dialogue)).

    From this entry we can establish basic premise of what has happened to Arkus since his squad had perished.

    Arkus is haunted by memory of his squad's last moments. Because of this, he was, for some reason, potentially supernatural, drawn to the statuary among other locations. Whether haunting is literal or a result of a trauma, is yet to be understood.

- `I could swear I heard them just now, their voices carrying in the wind. No longer screams, no longer cries - whispers. Indecipherable even in the stillness of this place` ([Arkus - Cryptic Statuary](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)).

    When the knight caught up to him, he advised to leave him, and during the second encounter he told no more voices were haunting him.

These haunting may be interpreted in two distinct ways. Given more somber themes of Arkus's narrative, we were initially more inclined to consider a grounded interpretation. And yet, as his fight progresses, reminiscent of Lord Vanaduke, as he exists within a highly mediavalistic, fantastic setting incorporating everything discussed to that point, we tend to consider a metaphysical source of his condition as more fitting without detriment to any depth of his character -- as if the haunting was metaphysical.

It is unknown whether Arkus is haunted by the souls of his squad or is driven mad by the presence of dark matter, as there are no definitive evidence for the prior, and no cases of souls or spirits haunting living Isorans willingly. Yet we can't deny the fact that spirits do return to material realm across Clockworks, and their effects on the material realm remain vague.

Dark matter itself is stated to `contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness` ([Dark Matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Dark_Matter)), and shadow damage is more precise in its definition: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` ([The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)).

The part involving `psychic manipulation` is important, which we suspect to be present to some extent, albeit through different means.

This theme of madness from presence of dark matter, is introduced in detail in [Acheron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Acheron), `this dark weapon has been known to drive weak-minded knights to the brink of madness`, and, partially, [Obsidian Edge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Edge), `A sinister sword made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. Simply holding it makes you somehow feel guilty of an unknown crime`. Despite the latter being an eldritch brandish, both are initially alchemized from the 3-star [Nightblade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightblade): `A short slicer infused with the essence of the Underworld`.

In continuation of the theme of silence, the [Silent Nightblade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silent_Nightblade) is described as `Crafted with some of the most devilish materials found on Cradle, this inky blade can explode with fiendish fury`. The only material added to the recipe compared to its 3-star version is the [Ghost Bell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Bell), an undead-themed material while the rest are fiend-themed. [Ghost Bell](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Bell) is described as `A small silvery bell worn by considerate ghosts that alerts the living when they are nearby` which is an antonym of silence, and the theme of the bell itself is one of declaring presence of death.

Is this `madness` which plagues Arkus, and is it also the haunting?

</BookCitation>-->

If the above scenario is true -- of Arkus being haunted, -- then this presents a scenario, in its uniqueness similar to the [Ghosts in the Machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine), as those souls communicate with the living. The aspect of benevolence can be seen here. As in the Iron Hulk, those souls, trapped in the machine were helping the knight. Here, likely souls ask Arkus to leave those feelings behind -- `In the eyes of these silent warriors I see myself: cold, strong, unflinching... and crumbling. I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do` ([Recon Module: Cryptic Statuary - Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)), and then the voices themselves seemingly leave Arkus -- `I could swear I heard them just now, their voices carrying in the wind. No longer screams, no longer cries- whispers. Indecipherable even in the stillness of this place. Are they leaving me here? Why must I be left behind?` ([Cryptic Statuary - Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary)).

And for the case of spirits remaining in the material realm, one item presents itself with the direct mention of haunting -- the 5-star [Dread Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Skelly_Shield), `It occasionally issues a quiet, forlorn whisper, usually about remembering to block` as well as its earlier 4-star precursor, the [Sinister Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sinister_Skelly_Shield), `A kite shield haunted by a benevolent ghost`.

So the souls haunt with intent of benevolence, yet it is up to the haunted to understand this guidance.

Those two items make us conclude on the scenario of __Arkus being haunted__ _by lingering souls of his squad_.

##### Spiral Wardens and Trojans Similarity: Part 1

Apart from those effects of dark matter, we need to establish a more defined nature of Arkus's physical state and relation to trojans through the analysis of other, more prominent, physical effect of dark matter.

What are the conditions of Arkus' transformation to a trojan? Is _dark matter being here a consequence or means of the transformation_? What part of this process is supposed to be symbolic in the first place, for example, how Arkus is a Spiral Warden, has warden's horse helmet while trojans possess similar horse appearance and a physical horse skull underneath the stone exterior of the helm as revealed in tier 2 and 3 trojan designs?

To resolve this, tortodrones are reintroduced through similarity to trojans. They are reactivated with the dark matter crystals as a power source. In order to power tortodrone with dark matter, its shell is deconstructed, and on its plates fiendish sigils are carved in place of eyes, potentially made of dark matter due to their glow and other instance of ritual circles made of dark matter.

It was already explored, how devilites may use those sigils, concluding to them being a [protective and summoning, utility measure](#ritual-circles-circle-of-art-pentacles).

Tortodrones' case suggests that _a violent intervention had to happen in order to place dark matter_. On the other hand, there are Lord Vanaduke, zombies and Carnavons, _who got the familiar purple glow through the curse-driven transformation_ -- mainly claws and inner glow of eyes and ribcage. In case of Arkus, as he is an Isoran, could've he gone through a similar process of potential death, as carnavons, or transfiguring curse, as Lord Vanaduke?

Here we have to bring up the case of devilite involvement, as they are usually ones responsible for Underworld-related activities across Clockworks:

- _They are encountered in the Call of the Colossi_;
- Across _Amu-Sol during the events of Heart of Ice_;
- They were present during _summoning of trojans from the legion of Ur_;
- They were _present in the Gauntlet alongside gremlins_.

And despite all of those instances, they are absent in the Cryptic Statuary. From native fiends there are only [Beryl Greavers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Beryl_Greaver) and trojans themselves.

Both trojans and devilites did come from the Underworld to Cradle. Moreover, Arkus is accompanied by greavers, from whom the entire history of Undercorp in the material realm had begun as [we had attempted to reconstruct it](#evil-eye).

##### Greavers

Greavers in that context are rather important entities. They have evil eye wing patterns, similar to moths, and in case of elemental greavers, those patterns glow.

As it was already covered in the [Arrival of Undercorp chapter](#undercorps-initial-advancements), Greavers are Underworld's military units, judging by the presence of a [shadow steel helm with a evil eye](#evil-eye) and the exact species from which imagery of the evil eye started to spread across planet of material realm, which was then incorporated into Cradle.

What their name means, symbolically? In a same manner as howlitzer are reminiscent of howitzers, could greavers be attributed to anything militaristic? First, there are greaves, a type of leg armour. This can potentially mean that __greavers are elite military units__. _We saw this first-hand in fiendish arenas_, where 12 Greavers, which are considered elite enemies, approach as the [final wave of the final arena starts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arena#Final_Wave_3).

We had suggested an inspiration behind greavers' design being moths. Apart from a similar shape and wing patterns, they play a significant role in Greek mythology.

Moths were believed to be carriers or be guidance for souls. Apart from it, Arkus's fight is one of a few instance of a text or Spiral Knight narrating over the events: `An intense sadness radiates from his fallen form. His eys fade and a darkness washes over him. Arkus is lost.` ([Arkus - inspection](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus)).

Could it be that during Arkus's fight in the Cryptic Statuary _greavers serve non-violent means of a soul refusing of departure_, chosing solitude over oblivion? Moreover, considering all of the known logic behind manipulation and transfer of souls, could it be that we have witnessed __Underworld's proper ancient method of capturing souls__, paralleling Apocrean Harvester, as both are insect-like creatures?

With this, we may now approach the analysis of effects of dark matter onto trojan and Isoran.

#### Minerals and Souls: Part 3 - Mineral Charge

Sparks of Life, or rather, an emergency revive, _supercharges dark matter shard in Arkus_, __forming small arcs of purple lightning__ on the first revive around the crystal.

On the second revive, those __arcs are seen all throughout Arkus's armor__.

The last stages in that regard resemble tier 3 trojans, as both do have a characteristic purple crystal fuming and lightning arcs. Arkus's dark matter shard, same as trojans', glows pink and __burns with the same purple flame, not found before initial revive__.

_This property of burning after a revive in mineral, we propose, is the depiction of mineral's now charged state._

Revising tortofists' ammo, there is potentially only other one instance of charged dark matter -- the projectiles of [Gorgofist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist). In that case the crystals are the same color as pillars, but they have bright purple pulsing glow as the rest of tortofists' ammo.

Throughout [Minerals and Souls](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), [Auras and Souls](#auras-and-souls), and [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) we had suggested that __minerals under unknown conditions could contain Energy-based charge__.

The Energy here being the medium for souls to exist in and through, and a link for the fuel of [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) under condition of being captured by the latter. That energy is contained in minerals as charge, one used to power Clockwork Gates, as suggested by Vaelyn's team technician: `We need to analyze how mineral power affects the Core. The problem is that very little power reaches down to these depths. We can gather so much data from each gate as it launches`. Although, this dialogue could potentially refer to an old method of gate construction, as it had remained unchanged after rework of energy system. But since the dialogue is in the game, and talks about gate launches themselves, we may also suggest a role of energy here being used as-is -- an important component not intended to be removed as it sheds light on the physics of minerals.

As no souls exit minerals, unlike everfrost, it is likely that it is rather a different form of energy contained within those minerals.

As mineral pillars are explicitly placed and stored across Clockworks, we can potentially suggest that those are in the depleted state. It is then a question of why gremlins had to store specifically depleted mineral?

There is presence of dark matter in a more raw formations such as [across dark cities](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Devilish_Drudgery-Scenario_Room5A.png), and around tortodrone-themed arenas. On the other hand, those could be shards of tortodrone missiles in a more cinematic perspective. Lastly, given those minerals are also observed in the arenas as being hidden behind Misery Blocks, we may propose that it is the most natural state dark matter is found in - in large chunks of mineral compared to the mineral pillars.

##### Instances of Charge

Now we cycle back to tortodrones, but in the context of souls. What connects tortodrones, trojans, and Arkus, is that all have dark matter present, it serves as, potentially, a power source, and is charged to the point of fuming/burning:

- Tortodrones have cracked shells with purple glow, purple lightning arcs and burning eyes.

    Crimsonite-powered tortodrones don't have burning eyes, but do have red lightning arcs throughout their shells.

    When a corrupted, or potentially, any tortodrone is defeated:

    - Its power pistons extend and purple mist is released, similar to mist of tier 2 trojans, attributed to [Baleful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Baleful_Aura#Baleful_Aura).
    - Tortodrone petrifies. Their shells and perceived bodies are made of stone and capable of being completely destroyed, once tortodrone deactivates.
    - The glyphs, carved on each individual shell of tortodrone stop glowing.
- Trojans, especially tier 3 have their internals, ribcage and eyes, seemingly cracked as stone and burning with the same brighter hue of purple-pink fire and visible lightning arcs.

    Their dark matter crystal on the back burns as well and is the same bright pink color, identical to Arkus at his first revive.

    When trojan is defeated, his crystal shatters, multiple purple explosions happen, and trojan petrifies.
- Arkus has the same dark matter crystal, with the first revive it starts to burn as well as emit arcs of purple lightning.

    With the second revive purple lightnings arcs traverse entirety of Arkus's armor.

    When Arkus is defeated, no shattered crystal is seen, but the purple explosions remain. Arkus does not turn to stone.
- Maulos has the same armour with skull imagery, ribcage, and revealed skull for a head as tier 3 trojans.

    He has everfrost instead of dark matter embedded, and has moonstone-like glow from the ribcage, but no burning flames. Presence of everfrost in place of dark matter was the foundational element for this soul-energy link within minerals.

    What sets him apart from trojans is the presence of everfrost onto his skull, forming a vertical spike. When he is defeated, the everfrost shard shatters with its distinct color.

All of those patterns seem to point a specificity of Dark Matter and by extension, everfrost, being connected, but also having similar underlying nature and effects.

To reiterate on [Minerals and Souls part 1 conclusion](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), those properties emerging from a connection to dark matter seem as one of arguments to energy in some capacity being contained in minerals. But then, this _leads to questioning if everfrost is a subtype of moonstone_, be it Underworld counterpart, or a changed by souls of Blinding Abyss moonstone? This currently is unknown, but plausible. As it is _capable of growing from Maulos's ribcage_, we have to point out the nature of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's and Carnavon's __claws -- made of dark matter, as if transformed__.

Could it be that __dark matter shard on trojans backs is a symptom, rather than a reason for their condition__?

Those aspects of both presence of dark matter and curse will be iterated upon in our [final analysis of curse](#intermission-analysis-of-curse).

##### Metaphysics of Souls and <span class="through-curse">Cursed Immortality</span>

As zombies are resurrected, as _Carnavons and Lord Vanaduke are animated by curse, which grants them immortality_, what have happened to Arkus, and by extension, Maulos, and the Legion of Ur to become fiends?

As far as information about Arkus claims, he could have either metaphorically or literally perish and then be brought back to life through curse, similar to the [crew of Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine), as they _haunt the ship as undead_, or, more likely, as _Lord Vanaduke on the altar of a volcanic deity_.

Apart from the transformation being seemingly caused by the _sheer grief and exposure to Underworld_ to be a reason, we have to search further, while assuming such case, as no evidence of Arkus's death before an encounter with him exist.

Trojans were _sealed in the Underworld and then summoned_, and _Maulos is summoned from Underworld or even Blinding Abyss_. Maulos brought influence of everfrost with him and is transformed by it or by being in the Blinding Abyss. When compared to trojans of Legion of Ur, who are also transformed, but accompanied by presence of dark matter, we noted on Maulos possessing a shar of everfrost, rather than dark matter.

Slag Walkers, and the rest of Almire's legion were scorched by shadow fires of Lord Vanaduke, as he returned from the mountains. _This does not explicitly mean death_, as souls of Almirians remain trapped - more about it now.

In that sense we suggest that presence of fiery souls after Firestorm Citadel' was partially cleansed by the waters from [Spirit Mother's Realm](#spirit-mothers-realm) and Vanaduke's defeat may reveal that _they were trapped in a corporeal form of perished or ashen Almirians_ in a similar manner as Lord Vanaduke is described by the [Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)): `Lord Vanaduke rules over the citadel now. His soul bound to some horrific armored prison. ... Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return` ([Alone in The Dark - Lost Souls of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue)). __That it is not the metaphysic of Cradle, which do not permit his soul to leave, but the curse itself__.

Souls are bound to the citadel, which burns as long as Lord Vanaduke is alive. The quote `His soul bound to some horrific armored prison` here, we believe, has 2 interpretations:

- Less of a reference to the citadel, _but to Lord Vanaduke's armor_, as the armor itself seems unnatural, transforming with the Lord, and by presence of word "some", which in the context of the entire dialogue seems to us as a reference to a different object.
- Referring to the Citadel itself. Once Lord Vanaduke is defeated, Nature Sprites had regained power to put out the fire: `Firestorm Citadel continues to burn with accursed flames. Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power` ([Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay)).

As the most of citadel is cleansed, the souls, mentioned in the quote `Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return`, are presented as [Fire Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Fire_Soul) in the [Overgrown Court](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court).

We will keep those interpretations in mind, once we will be able to cover Shadow Firestorm Citadel and Darkffire Vanaduke specifically.

###### Static Souls

This setup and physics, on the other hand, contradict presence of souls in the [Dry Docks](#ghosts-in-the-machine). The problem, as we see it, stems from the fact souls of Almire are being released from the curse, which had them bound to the citadel and its legion of undead, - this is what allowed them to transform into incorporeal lost souls - [Fire Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Fire_Soul). The fact that those souls contain element of fire may point to a type of containment they were in - here sealed by the Vog's or Vanaduke's fiery curse.

###### Frozen Souls

In case of Heart of Ice, [Frozen Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Frozen_Soul) are as such due to being released from Everfrost, connecting them to the Blinding Abyss and cold in general, referring to our [analysis of Blinding Abyss](#perma-frostifurs-and-blinding-abyss).

Non-elemental Lost Souls of the graveyards are as such due to more mutual process of resurrection - as they are _not bound by curse and are manifested through properties of Cradle which make spirits return to the material realm_. But in case of the Ghost in The Machine - [Static Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Soul#Static_Soul) are already released, despite them still inhabiting the circuits of the Skydome containing the vessel in the form of Dry Docks.

There, the same manner of haunting is present, and why souls would still exist in their unbound state, remains unknown, unless Underworld's presence of greater in that location, such as the case of graveyards.

[Void Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Void_Soul) will be explored during [analysis of the Swarm]().

###### Freed Souls

Finally, Freed Souls were bound by the traps of Apocrea, which manifest in the properties of Grasping Plateau and metaphysics of harvester capable of manipulating, harvesting those souls, as well as draining them from one carrying them.

It is also there it is seen that Apocrean Harvester is capable of extracting souls from captured knights through the application of the purple beam of light, similar to ones found across depths' near Apocrean Realm within the shroud. _This process of extraction also damages the knight_.

Although Auras in that regard remain mostly unknown, the nature of this connection between all of the above concepts seems here evident, potentially even, as different manifestations of the same base concept of Energy.

This can potentially tie in with the concept of [auras](#auras-and-souls), as they should represent an essential part of being. So damaging them, if we take an idea of a soul as a subtle body, would translate to directly damaging the body. Presence of multiple souls can be explained either by knight to be assumed to collect those souls, or by a being an entity of material realm - as if presence of the souls would link living being to a higher realm, access to which is seemingly desired by Apocrea.

As the souls after being frred from purple chains are seen to fly away, similar to them flying from golden light at the Departure, we would argue that Harvester does not drain collected souls of the knight, but taps into its nature as enity possessing a soul - for the means of fuealing Apocrean Engines. This would lead to the idea of a single soul being a partial representation of a being, rather than the totality of it, as this logic would explain an observed phenomenon of a soul being forcibly split into identical entities. Only when entitrety of the soul is drained, and as the knight perishes, the exstraction of the soul can be considered complete.

At that, the purple chains seen to encircle freed souls within the Grasping Plateau, we prpose, are of the same nature as purple energy seen across obsidian weaponry, obelists, and locations of Apocrean Realm - Departure and Obsidian Nexus.

#### Arkus

Could it be that only death causes loss of consciousness given nature of zombies and Lost Souls? But in case of Arkus, Lord Vanaduke, and potentially Maulos, _they preserve it_, despite going mad or delirious.

This connects to each individuals' powers, as Arkus, despite being partially a trojan and a fiend, has orbiting dark orbs, similar to Vanaduke - in both cases demonstrating magic rarely seen in the wild.

Those dark orbs are also seen in Warmaster Seerus' anti-gremlin bomb, [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution), and [neutralizer's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Neutralizer) projectiles. Apart from that, as here we won't analyze gremlin technology, what else connects the two? Both Vanaduke and Arkus were grieving, which may also play part in their transformation, as discussed earlier.

At the same time, as this topic is directly linked to deific presence, [Vog explicitly transforms selected creatures](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776): `The great fire beast Vog isn't a wolver himself, but a fiery deity of sorts who embraces some creatures and grants them a bit of power. Vog's 'cubs' are more or less acquired and forced to spread his fiery love across the world`.

Lastly, Arkus's sword slam attack has pink lightning strike from above, and forms dark crimsotine shards. Those depleted crimsonite shards are the same as tortodrones'. The pink lightning strike may be similar to the one present during summoning of Margrel. [We will explain this phenomenon](#the-resonance), once we have enough information on it. But, due to aforementioned relation to Margrel and yet not analyzed nature of [Dread Seals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal), we will return also to this question [later](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

Arkus's transformation may potentially tie in with the location of dust zombie ambush and influence of Underworld. By the concept of Cryptic Statuary, apart from housing stone trojans, belonging implicitly to heavenly kingdom and explicitly by the elevator icon, in that regard, we can speculate that the location of ambush is related to trojans and their transformation - relating to that period in time, when or where trojans were created.

This time period then should be before Almire's Fall, as Legion of Ur had to exist in the Underworld and conquer it.

This may lead to 2 candidates, as we see it: Clockwork Tunnels, as the Statuary is in the tunnels, and Graveyards, - as both have dust zombies, but the latter has only dust zombies without any status effects, apart from curse. Moreover, Graveyards belong to the kingdom of Almire, which makes those zombies people of Almire. As Almire itself is in a permanent state of being cursed, as its lands are cursed, and as [Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire) is single location of largest concentration of curse, [apart from one other instance](#miasma), the concept of it dooming anyone traversing its territory would seem fitting.

This would also mean a commitment to an idea of curse being the reason, and dark matter manifestation being the symptom, which we will discuss next.

#### Dark Matter as Manifestation of Curse

As Lord Vanaduke was granted immense power and cursed immortality as he asked to destroy enemy kingdoms, we suggest the same can be told of trojans, spiral wardens of medieval age, as seen by tier 1 design. But is the action, which has cursed those Wardens, did they knew the consequences of this deal with a deity? We lean here to the narrative of a deal with the devil, a deal attached with strings, the strings here being the method through which the desired goal is achieved. _If we commit to this idea if devil's deal, now given that Legion of Ur had conquered the Underworld, what was their wish_?

To compare with Lord Vanaduke, trojans, in this framework seem to be the result of a large scale process of curse, transforming into horse-like beasts, with their armor turning to stone, while retaining some features, seen even in the modern Spiral Order. But the difference lies in the process itself - while Lord Vanaduke's transformation seems to be gifted to him by Vog, that is unknown of Trojans, as well as of Arkus.

As discussed in previous section - it is unknown, what are the conditions which allow for the curse to take affect, transforming its bearer. We have a pattern of grieving, which may or may not serve as a catalyst.

But, exactly here lies the basis of our proposal. Lord Vanaduke, and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke have respective similarity to Slag Zombies and Carnavons by the fact of transformed claws - those are the result of the transformation. And for trojans, their position and role as defenders _twists them in the same thematic manner_ - as they become wardens, but as a fiendish army, invincible from the front, and vulnerable from the back. The vulnerability stems from the crystal. And for Vanaduke, it is his mask, a symbol for somethings. As a king, he carries his scepter, which was linked to the concept of Justice, while twisted by curse and burned by shadow flames: `Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke` ([Legion of Almire - Inner Sanctum - Almirian codex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum)).

If we attempt to apply logic behind Almirians' transformation, then crystal of dark matter becomes the manifestation of the curse. In case of Lord Vanaduke that manifestation of the curse was his claws and the mask, and potentially the general stature. The mask seem to have a mind of its own, as it operates throughout the fight by itself. It has a small red gem in the forehead, but this is a different topic. This mask's eye pattern can be seen all across the Citadel, oven columns of the buildings.

#### Spiral Wardens and Trojans Similarity: Part 2

One another concept we found interesting, is the thematic element of petrification in the context of eldritch Myths, specifically, their predecessor, "The King in Yellow", mentioned in relation to Apocrea. In "The King in Yellow", the short story of "The Mask" had the element of petrification, wherein any object submerged into a mixture would turn too marble with a pink inner glow, and after a while returning back to its natural state:

<BookCitation source="Robert Chambers - The King in Yellow, The Mask">

  He held the lily toward me, and I took it in my hand. It had turned to stone, to the purest marble. The marble was white as snow, but in its depths the veins of the lily were tinged with palest azure, and a faint flush lingered deep in its heart. ... But if you held it to the light the stone was beautifully veined with a faint blue, and from somewhere within came a rosy light like the tint which slumbers in an opal.

</BookCitation>

This reminds us of the Cryptic Statuary, and potential reasons for its establishment. Herein we also should point out dark matter crystal burning, similar to the rays of light present in alchemized, as stated by Alec, marble:

<BookCitation source="Robert Chambers - The King in Yellow, The Mask">

  "There is one thing I'm curious about," I said, "and that is where the ray of sunlight came from." ... "It looked like a sunbeam true enough," he said. "I don't know, it always comes when I immerse any living thing. Perhaps," he continued, smiling, "perhaps it is the vital spark of the creature escaping to the source from whence it came." ... I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for gold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Genevieve came in shortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.

</BookCitation>

The reason we brought up this story here is the earlier idea of poisoned minds and cold heart as the depths' names of Silent Legion mission.

This confusion of being turned to stone _as death or a form of immortality_ may be _related to the idea of poisoned minds_, _tied with the idea of Underworld Deities fulfilling the deal_, but in a _twisted manner, potentially as part of a larger plot_, where wardens were lied to.

The reasons for this scenario may potentially lie in the suggestion of immortal or eternal servitude - as under current logic, _we know that Spiral Wardens do abide to Guardian's Oath, and them betraying it would be equal to death_ - a symbolic death referred to Arkus, and literal death for Vanaduke.

Since we are referring here to Guardian's Oath, and we do not know its contents, we will mention relations to it:

- `Grantz was the real veteran of the bunch. A seasoned Guardian, Grantz specialized in keeping his squad safe, namely by crushing anything that would mean to do them harm. Grantz took his Guardian's Oath very seriously, often putting himself directly in harm's way in order to protect another. The guy was selfless. I imagine that if disaster truly befell the Alpha Squad, Grantz didn't let it end without one hell of a fight` ([The Pioneers - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers)).
- `Guardian Knight Arkus was one of the finest warriors serving the Spiral Knights until some time shortly after the crash. As one of the first to search for the Alpha Squad, Arkus's own squad perished in a grisly battle with a horde of dust zombies. Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad. Arkus now journeys into the Clockworks alone, never risking the loss of another squad and we believe, somehow trying to find the squad he once lost. As these expeditions began to appear self-deconstructive, Spiral HQ issued him a direct order to cease. Arkus ignored these orders and has gone deep into the Clockworks and has not returned. Not wanting to lose the last of his squad, Spiral HQ is asking you to pursue him to his last known whereabouts, some kind of mysterious sanctuary at depth 26` ([The Silent Legion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion)).
- `Heavy weapons require precise timing to use effectively and the gear tends to slow you down some. But what you sacrifice in usability is returned in sheer power. The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that your squad can depend upon to stay alive and face even the fiercest of monsters` ([Izola](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Izola)).
- `Strong, yet light armor for knights who've sworn an oath to hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk` ([Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail)).

    It may be connected to [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher): `A powerful cold iron blade forged for the singular purpose of hunting down and destroying the undead`, and it is connected, similar to the [Leviathan Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Leviathan_Blade). It is very likely that those who did wear this armor were in a similar position to Wardens, but, the armor itself strongly related to valkyries and their actions onto Underworld. So, we have a large gap, which might lead to the history of the Legion of Ur, __given that both have an extremely fantasy-themed equipment__.

Would then Wardens be at the precipice of potentially becoming immortal or invulnerable though those means, and being lied to, becoming the enemies of once they promised to protect? Then whom, under those extreme conditions, they would sworn to protect, while allowing them to the transformed becoming fiends? _If trojans' minds are poisoned, considering their alliance with devilites as a Legion of Ur, does it mean that it is the rest of the material realm who they are made to hold disdain of_?

Could this narrative tie with the Sleeper, even: `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME. VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)), in the same manner, as Valkyries were also possessing a role as guardians? This would align with the concept of Undercorp and rest of soul-harvesting civilizations to compromise the defenses of the realm from which this energy in form of souls comes from. In this iteration, our proposed narrative of Wardens being those guardians and then being twisted by Underworld seems be fitting.

For this, we will need to look into a different period of time, preceding Almire and a war of those 3 kingdoms, leading up to theorized ancient arrival of Isorans to this planet before Cradle.

#### Nature of Darkfire

While we will not touch upon [the canon of Shadow Lairs](#shadow-lairs), what important now is to analyze nature of Darkfire, as it is associated to the most cursed location currently, be it regular Firestorm Citadel or Shadow Firestorm Citadel. We will attempt to find connections to the metaphysics of souls and minerals, and specifically _nature of curses in material realm_.

It is stated that Darkfire Lord Vanaduke became such, - a distinct entity from Lord Vanaduke, due to an unknown powerful curse falling onto the firestorm citadel: `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Lord Vanaduke!` ([Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)). This curse is manifested most prominently in the different transformation of Lord Vanaduke, pink glow of volcanic chamber, and presence of Carnavons, and all are affected by the curse. Does this mean that Darkfire Lord Vanaduke or darkfire in general is created through Vog's curse, followed by a different, more widespread and present curse associated with the curse status effect?

Carnavons in that matter serve as a link of this curse being the same as one taking effects on Isorans in the form of the curse status effect, _even possessing a crudely drawn sigil of the same color on their blackened crests_.

Black Kats, mentioned in relation to Auras in the [Auras and Souls section](#auras-and-souls), also have this capacity to inflict curse, and all having the [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal) with an image of evil eye, which links to the Underworld.

This curse also exists outside of Shadow Lairs as Carnavons are summoned by Black Kats across Clockworks, and the latter are being summoned by an unknown party.

Carnavons' blackened crests have same purple cracks instead of fiery ones, similar to trojans, but the latter are incapable of inflicting curse, and only Carnavons have inscribed curse symbol of their Almirian Crests.

Lord Vanaduke became an immortal giant after his initial transformation by Vog and due to this Firestorm Citadel has been burning for at least thousand of years. We know that Lord Vanaduke has power over flame souls and his mask, to which we will return soon, as it has another flame soul, behaving seemingly as a standalone entity, and stated to be Vanaduke's source of power: `Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Throne_Room)). There is also armor, which seems to be transformed with the wielder itself, having large chains holding it together, similar to a cage in both instances of Lord Vanaduke. We point out those element as we will return to them one more time in the context of a [dedicated analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire).

Finally, [Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember) _can be acquired without descending into the Shadow Lairs_. [Dark Ember's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember) description states: `A mote of burning energy salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time`. This description is vague, as it does not attribute to any version of the Citadel, but, as the inventory icon depicts it as purple mote, _we attribute it to the source of darkfire_. Yet, there are no known laws, apart from themes, which would forbid dark embers to be present in the regular Citadel, as the color of Firestorm Citadel is of regular, red fire, albeit referred by Nature Sprites as Shadow Fire.

Another instance of purple flame is seen across Moorcroft Manor in floating fire bowls. Weather it is the same dark ember is unknown, but it would plausible, since those same embers are found across Shadow Firestorm Citadel. As far as specificity of those elements goes, it can be an asset reuse, similar to [Skylark's secondary generator](#skylark).

Due to those factors, as well as unknown canonicity of Shadow Firestorm Citadel, we need to work through each instance of purple color carefully and through multiple iteration as we gather more information on the metaphysics.

These factors make us think of Vog's curse being still unfamiliar to Spiral Order, only seen experienced directly through the properties of [Fang of Vog](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog), while curse status effect represents a greater Curse, a more widespread and afflicting Spiral Knights as a game mechanic. Both have a distinct, cracked or shattered design on the afflicted entities, be it equipment or creatures.

In this distinction, we may suggest for now that _there are 2 curses - one of fire of Vog, and the other of the same nature as seen outside of the Citadel_. Both of those curses originate from the Underworld and are capable of trapping or binding souls and inflict undeath onto creatures of material realm, a form of cursed immortality, as in earlier instances of this phenomenon.

This can be further affirmed by the description of Citadel being cursed, __as if the curse was applied externally__, rather than an emergent property of the prior. This fits with the design of Carnavons, as _they have a crudely drawn curse symbol drawn on their Blackened Crest_ - __someone had to draw it__. But, it is unknown weather this mark and the dread seal is the source of curse, or even their general role. We are yet to cover them in the context of Black Kats and Kat Tribe.

Then, by the fact of Citadel being cursed, we can suggest that Slag Walkers became Carnavons through this curse and, as both wear armor, we had previously attributed both to the Almirian army.

Not all members of legion of Almire are burning in darkfire, leaving crusaders and royal guards as ones transformed through Lord Vanaduke's initial arrival from the mountains, as they retain their color scheme.

Those factor seems to us as an initial bridge between those types of curse and dark matter. Darkfire could be considered in that context a unique phenomenon emerging from Underworld fires. Then, is Shadow Fire the same phenomenon as Darkfire?

While Shadow Fire had its own design, acknowledged by Nature Sprites, darkfire is explicitly purple and remains as such through the information gathered from the designs of Shadow Firestorm Citadel and Dark Embers. As far as we can be aware, there are multiple sources of purple fire, including a burning dark embers, which are a significant source of confusion for us.

This leaves us with 2 initial proposals:

- Darkfire is the same pink fire that accompanies trojans of tier 2 and 3, as well as Arkus, Carnavons, and fire bowls of Moorcroft Manor, as well as of Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

    This proposal is based on prior design similarities across all of those subjects, albeit with slight color variations.
- Darkfire is the result of 2 curses merging - giving to Vog's fires this curse-bearing or curse-inflicting property, different from a transformative fiery curse, as one seen across Legion of Almire.

    And, as this purple curse seems to be far more widespread and as only it has the connection to the evil eye, and adopted it as its symbol among Spiral Order, as well as presence of Underworld's cultural imprint - in case of Tortomega.

    Another argument fot this explanation is based on the design of a unique fire soul behind Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's mask - no such color is present across Cradle so far - of red-pink curse aura and purple core, combining both fiery aspect of Lord Vanaduke, but also being color-coded as curse-bearing element.

    This orb of fire, as far as curse color-coded fire allows, could be a distinct presence of curse, separate from dark embers, which are explicitly purple, but thematically fitting to reddish color of curse [found prior in the collapsed grim gates](#grim-gates-portal-collapse).

It is also important to note that Dark Ember, being a boss trophy, was added [after](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2012-12-12) [introduction](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19) of Shadow Lairs, with nearly a year of a gap. So far we will only hold onto this information until [reaching analysis of Shadow Lairs](#shadow-lairs).

Considering many instances of unreliable narrations so far, even with cases such as Nameless Realm, while is named once, darkfire, due to Vanaduke's mask argument and existence of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, darkfire seems to us as a distinct phenomenon, attributed to dark embers. And, as latter are specified as `A mote of burning energy salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time` ([Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)), we have to look into the canon of the events involving traversal of [Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire).

As of now, we propose that both of those curses have underlying common nature, emerging from the Underworld, as well as its deities:

- Vog's curse gives the curse-bearer power to exist beyond regular laws of their species, the case of Isorans it is Lord Vanaduke.

    Lord Vanaduke had transcended ages while being bound to his armor, and capable of upholding entire Citadel in stasis, with his mask being important to his state.
- Maulos is transformed by everfrost, seem to have retained mind of his own, compared to rest of trojans.

    He is capable of frost magic affecting an entire fiendish city of Amu-Sol. And as trojans were already covered, we believe that the curse in question can manifest differently depending on its application, resulting in different effects and magnitude, but inevitably tracing back to the Underworld and greater understanding of nature of shadow damage.

##### Spiral Wardens and Trojans Similarity: Part 3

When dark matter crystal is shattered, trojan petrifies, he can potentially be reanimated from stone, but it was not ever seen. As a matter of fact, trojan petrifies. If we take into account similarity of Arkus and other trojans, we lean to a conclusion of trojans being transformed by the curse, which manifested as dark matter, and housed their souls. More connection toSpiral Wardens emerge here, as the [warden's or colossal prize box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Colossal_Prize_Box) contains a prismatic back crystal, called with a odd name - [Ruinous Crystal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Ruinous_Crystal), __one that brings ruin__. _Its presence within Spiral Order-themed prize box seems extremely ominous_.

We have to point out that wardens are called here as colossi, reminding of the [Call of the Colossi](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi). There, the colossi were seemingly tortodrones, or tortomega, [who were calling for tortodrones on a Long Migration](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland), as we have previously explored there [fall to Undercorp](#the-titans-tortomega-the-fall). [Warden Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warden_Helm) is also described as `The helm of the Stalwart Spiral Wardens is said to give great comfort to other knights. Nothing says "here comes the cavalry" like the sight of these iron giants taking to the battlefield`, associating wardens to giants.

The further element, linking trojans and wardens is found in the [announcement itself](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95960): `Spiral Wardens are well known for being guardians and protectors, sworn to put the safety of others before their own. Are you up to the challenge of becoming one of these brave champions? If you are, you need to look the part! Through February 3rd, 2014, get distinctive Spiral Warden horse head costume items in Colossal Prize Boxes! (Or if you want a touch of corruption in your life and you'd rather look like a Trojan, you can do that too.*) Contents of the Colossal Prize Box may include: Warden Armors and Helms; Trojan Tail accessory; Baleful Aura; Prismatic Ruinous Crystal accessory; Fireworks in every box! Read all the details right here.` ([Onward to the Year of the Horse!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95960)).

This directly characterized trojans as corrupted, which follows our suggestion of them being falling under corruptive, or ruinous influence. Yet, the name `ruinous` is vague as it does explicitly the reason for the corruption, but makes strong implication to be the catalyst for it.

We would lean to this idea of the crystal being the catalyst, rather than a symptom, but given presence of other dark matter instances - of Carnavons' and Lord Vanaduke's claws, it seems less likely even with the entire plot of corrupted tortodrones.

We made previously a suggestion of the sigils either summoning the crystal or securing it, but, as tortodrones are constructs, it should be also considered.

Lastly, there is Arkus, who is also in possession of dark matter crystal. As our idea of him physically perishing sometime during his traversal of Clockworks seems to thin, he would have no case of an intervention, through which a crystal could've been embedded.

Trojan's [Baleful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Baleful_Aura#Baleful_Aura) is one which is most seen on tier 2 trojans, suggesting it being as important to the laws of this affliction, as the ruinous crystal.

Lastly, there the [Warden Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warden_Armor) in its design, chestpiece specifically, is identical to the redwood chestpiece design of tier 1 trojans.

Considering so far all of those aspects, we believe that a long time ago, __Spiral Wardens were transformed into trojans of the Legion of Ur__ before even Skylark and Iron Hulk crash landed on Cradle. This time would precede Almire, as Lord Vanaduke had to return with this legion, but not after the it would be sealed in the Underworld by Valkyries. The transformation, which had to happen then, could potentially be similar to one Arkus has to go through, as he already identified as a fiend.

As mentioned earlier, we will make the second iteration of this concept, as we approach Shadow Lairs.

##### Vanaduke's Mask and <span class="through-curse">Immortality Through Curse</span>

The exact nature of Blackened Shrine is unknown, although, as it is very likely a fiendish device by proprty of it being capable of inducing a tranformation.

We suspect it being similar to grim totems, which are the only fiendish objects, capable of resurrecting zombies from their own skulls. Could it be that the skull is the remaining and essential part from which resurrection can be performed? __We saw Lost Souls being housed within the skulls__ [all across Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)).

And if so, could similar principal be applied to Lord Vanaduke's mask, as it is stated: `Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke#About))?

Lord Vanaduke's mask seemingly lives on its own, while Lord Vanaduke is invincible. Notably, the mask on its inner side has a flame soul or curse-colored soul, or darkfire soul. In the first case it is the same as ones observed to be orbiting Lord Vanaduke after initial damage to the mask. The second case is, as [described earlier](#nature-of-darkfire), makes it unique, due to which we suspect it being depiction of darkfire with a characteristic color, attributed to curse.

When mask is damaged enough, it returns to its owner in as a fiery soul, exploding on contact, which seems to be staggering Vanaduke. We believe that this is Vanaduke's soul most present. This can be reaffirmed by the fact that only his orbiting fiery orbs have eyes, but [are referred as flame souls on the wiki](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke), likely similar entities found as a material - [Flame Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul): `A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage`. The same proposal we made, when we had analyzed the meaning behind Lost Souls of Almire quote: `His soul bound to some horrific armored prison` ([Alone in the Dark - Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue)). But, given the fact that Lord Vanaduke is the source of the damnation, and his armor's cage-like design, we suspect the _second interpretation of his armor being his prison_ to be more likely. More so, when Lord Vanaduke is defeated, we see a small flame erupt from his faceplate, seemingly being that exact soul.

Compared to trojans, on defeat, Vanaduke's body completely burns up, with only his scepter remaining. But, as evident by later alchemized [Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Mask) and [Finery](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Finery), those elements had remained of him:

- `The sinister mask formerly worn by Vanaduke, Lord of the Firestorm Citadel. its far too big for a knight to wear` ([Vanaduke's Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Mask)). It is alchemized with the usage of [Soul Dust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul_Dust): `The dust of the departed. Whether it still retains any shred of a soul remains to be seen`.
- `An artistic arrangement of Lord Vanaduke's mask, armor and scepter. It represents the folly of greed, the agony of despair, and how awesome fire and spikes look together` ([Finery](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Finery)).

Mask's description suggests that it was taken of the Lord after the events of the King of Ashes: `The sinister mask formerly worn by Vanaduke, Lord of the Firestorm Citadel. its far too big for a knight to wear` ([Lord Vanaduke's Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke's_Mask)). Based on this, we lean to an explanation that in canon timeline __Lord Vanaduke's mask was salvaged__. We also suggest, as his scepter remains after death, the finery was also taken from the Citadel, despite it burning up in the mission. As for the resourced required to alchemize the mask, they do expand on the state of the mask itself. More so, compared to most of the roster of [Armero Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armero_Alchemy_Machine), Almire's furniture is not said to be replicated:

- `A magnificently preserved royal seal of the lost kingdom of Almire. It probably belongs in a museum` ([Almirian Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Seal_(Furniture))).
- `A jolly piece of jewelry formerly borne by the Royal Jelly himself. It is jauntily perched on a gelatinous pillow` ([Royal Jelly Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Crown_(Furniture))).

    That is while [Royal Jelly Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Crown) as the equipment is stated to be reproduced: `Ruggedly royal regalia recently reproduced from regally resinous remains`. Seemingly the same can be said of [Ice Queen Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown): `A regal crown resembling that ever-frigid Ice Queen. In addition to providing great defense, it is said to dramatically boost one's ego and create a cold detachment from those around them`.

- `A squishy gem highly prized by slimes. This one was liberated from the Royal Jelly Palace and painstakingly preserved as a conversation piece` ([Jelly Gem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Gem_(Furniture))).

The fact that both kingdoms' trophies are considered unique to a degree, we can draw parallels to them [containing gremlin consoles](#gremlin-containments-and-consoles), which is a pattern.

The presence of remains of Vanaduke's soul within his mask can be identified by the themes of equipment alchemized with the Soul Dust, specifically the case of [Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Skelly_Shield) alchemy line. This line of shields was touched upon when we [analyzed truthfulness of Arkus's haunting](#haunting), concluding on it being valid. Here we delve into alchemical materials for those items, as their presence both for the Mask and the Finery is very specific. The [Sinister Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sinister_Skelly_Shield) is the first one to specify presence of ghost - `A kite shield haunted by a benevolent ghost`, - at the same time as [Blighted Bone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blighted_Bone) is presented into its alchemy.

The [Scary Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scary_Skelly_Shield), a 3-star item, is the first to use Soul Dust, but has no mention of haunting: `A small, spooky shield to safeguard you from shadow` ([Scary Skelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scary_Skelly_Shield)).

This tells one thing to us: Soul Dust is not the source of haunting, but blighted bone is the material which ultimately results in __spirit binding to an object__, likely with the assistance of the Soul Dust and Grave Soil. We can suggest that is is soul's corporeal body, its remains, that of bones, or an object which allow for it to exist in such state.

This concept can be applied to the distinction between Lord Vanaduke's Mask and Finery, with the latter being seemingly haunted by his presence though burning eys of the mask.

Finery is the one utilizing [Blighted Bone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blighted_Bone) in its alchemy. This may not explicitly mean, that the departed Vanaduke's souls is rebound, but some ot its image remains, as specified by the [Soul Dust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul_Dust): `The dust of the departed. Whether it still retains any shred of a soul remains to be seen`.

##### Lord Vanaduke's Mask Design

As for the design of the mask, one element we mentioned several times was the _red gem embedded into the mask_. Across cultures such symbolism is usually referred to the _Third Eye or a connection to otherworldly forces_. In case of Lord Vanaduke, we would argue that the mask is manifestation of the curse and is the face of the deity by the reasoning that Almirian Armor remains similar to Spiral Order in its medieval designs, and presence of unconventional elements is rare.

The only close case of similar themes are the [Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm) and [Diablo Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Diablo_Helm), both of them preserve general Spiral Order designs. This may be potentially affirmed by the design of the _spike-like jaw_, as in cases of [Authentic Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Phantom_Mask) [Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask) and [Fiend Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask) all of them referencing a skull with a greater accent of the undeath and Underworld, __as if this symbolism is characteristic of Underworld as the [evil or curse eye](#evil-eye)__.

Lastly, it is mask's design which is observed across the citadel, specifically, it is present on the stone columns of brick walls.

While this may serve as a closure for Almire, Legion of Ur, which we suggested to be the fiendish army led by Lord Vanaduke, remains unsolved despite potential reasons for their transformation being vaguely defined. We had proposed them being formed before kingdom of Almire, as former Isoran Wardens. They would outlast Almire and it is how they became sealed we must discuss next.

### _Intermission &#160;<br>_ Gunslinger Priests

After assisting Lord Vanaduke, a fiendish army, which we so far [proposed]() to be the Legion of Ur, returned into the Underworld: `With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)).

Under current theory, heavenly kingdom up to that moment in time was not affected nor involved with Lord Vanaduke's crusade from the mountains. But, we have a few items, suggesting an existing conflict between Valkyries and Underworld:

- `Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld` ([Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin)).

    Here we are presented with gunslingers, who have descended into the Underworld and witnessed it. So far on the timeline the only people to witness Underworld, remotely even, were _trojans_ and _magmatic cultists_, the trojans being a more ancient examples, related to Isorans and a narrative of those landing onto Cradle before existence of Almire, as discussed in their [analysis]().

    Then we have an _advanced enough technology and magic_ to allow creation of a such handguns through transmutation, as well as knowledge of _draconic designs_, present though Battle Sprites' interface. Although here referred as, or placed alongside griffins, based on the name and draconic designs on handgun's barrel, it is an item of unknown origin so far, attribution of which to a specific civiliation will be discussed later.

    The griffin in question may be referring to the apparition of a griffin during handgun's charge. This ties with a still vague nature of those handgun creators' species and their role in that period of time.

- `A holy sword created in another time to arm knights who fought against the legions of the Underworld` ([Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger)).
- `An upgraded Avenger formed from the purest sun steel. There are few foes remaining in this world that are worthy enough to be defeated by such a fine blade, and there are still fewer heroes worthy of wielding it` ([Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_avenger)).

    Avengers have similar design to the [Heavenly Guardian Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor) due to distinct presence of curling trails of light, wich is our current working assumtion. The armor specifically does look like one belonging to knights of modern Spiral Order, if judged by, for example, [Heavenly Guardian Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Helm), as its is particularly reminiscent of Spiral Order's [Mighty Cobalt Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Helm). Those similarity if not implies heavenly kingdom being potentially inhabited by Isorans, but close relation of the two, reminding of the discussion weather people of Almire are Isorans.

A few of those items establish a distinct theme of divinity, heavenly properties and guardianship.

#### Owlites and Valkyries of Heavenly Kingdom

It is important to address the lingering inconsistency of the species of the heavenly kingdom, - what are valkyries?

Valkyries were the heavenly kingdom's army and people, as suggested by [Angelic Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm): `A beautiful helm made to resemble a heavenly guardian`.

The heavenly kingdom was [supposedly located]() on the grounds of what later became the Scarlet Fortress in present time, and it was already capable of flight prior to Clockworks' constructon, as suggested by the [Avenger Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm): `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain`. This makes it implicit as well as _thematically fitting for the inhabitants of this flying kingdom being an avian species_, and __so far we were leaning to an idea of valkyries being a name for Owlites who were part of the army, the "heavenly guardians"__, as to those requirements both valkyries and Owlites could fit, while being a [key element]() to our proposal of tortomega being the titans.

But, as valkyries are tied through their name to norse mythology, them being Owlites seems while fascinating as a concept, it does not fit with current themes of Owlites being a separate species, _whose strategies are focused on ranged combat using magic_, with widely present themes of fantasy wizardry.

Far earlier, we have suggested, that this could be a multi-species civilization, or that we have encountered a case of a distinct separation of duties within valkyrian army, with the academy being an entity focused on research of magics and their later application in combat.

On the other hand, valkyries seem to be too distinct in their designs, even if we consider a case of the being Owlites physiologically, - the same motif of wings seems far too redundant then, - which was one of primary reasons for our suspicions on them being separate species.

At that, we should evaluate the hypothesis of Valkyries and Owlites being identical species through analysis of items, which we belive would allow for deeper understanding of both, while keeping in mind their avian motif, as well as looking at the overarching themes and designs.

[Owlite Robe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Robe) heavily implies their upper limbs used to be wings or seem as such, while capable of holding and grabbing, apart from being used for flight. On the contrary, Valkyries could have had wings on their backs, as implied by the design of [Valkyrie Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Wings) and [a raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiment_(Costume)): `A long, flowing battle garb best accessorized with a pair of angelic wings`. This approach is reminiscent of Spiral Order [adding wings to preexisting designs](), specifically, of Almire, as most recent.

As Owlites in the [respective news art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SpiralKnights_News_254-big.png) carry an [astrolabe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Astrolabe), - due to its presence we can suggest a more direct inclusion of magic, as symbols carved on the outer ring of astrolabe are similar to ones present of the [Enchanted Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Enchanter_Aura#Enchanter_Aura) and Owlite robe, specifically, _a star and a crescent moon_. The prior symbols are similar to [fiendish sigils](#fiendish-glyphs), but possess a more arcane shape. What is important in this context, is that _Valkyries lack any of those arcane themes_. This makes our suggestion of Owlites as they are seen to come from a different time, close to Kataclysm, but, as Valkyries already possess intances of magic - prime example being Avenger blades, - incorporating those advancements in their armors and weapons suggests a connection in this direction.

As this approach only allows to establish _general themes_ of each civilization, we will analyze Valkyries and Owlite from a different perspective - of _common weaknesses_:

- 3-star `A beautiful suit of armor that constantly shines as if illuminated by the sun` ([Angelic Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Raiment)), up to 5-star [Valkyrie Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail) line of upgrades: `A priceless set of armor whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` are observed to be vulnerable to fire, but resistant to curse and poison. Poison so far was also associated to shadow damage, from which those armors grant protecton, fitting for an opposite of Underworld.

- `It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire` ([Heavenly Iron Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor)). Compared to above upgrade line, it is resistant to fire, but vulnerable to shock.

    Fire resistance is neutral in that case, yet it can be considered an upgrade, _as specified by the armor itself_, affirming it being a higher tier upgrade to 5-star [Valkyrie Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail). As it is acquired through preparation and traversal of Shadow Lairs, it seems thematically fitting, as the highest-tier armor among Valkyries.

    At this point we already have a motif of __valkyries being weak to fire. At that, we consider "celestial beings" to be valkyries__. The description implies, that _it is beings themselves that are weak to fire_.

- `A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` ([Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen)) is different in that regard, while it has _same resistance to fire as Heavenly Iron set_, it is by all aspects corrupted by Underworld, and belonging to a celestial being, suggesting weakness to curse, reminiscent of Nature Sprites.

    This characteristic is evident given armor's and helm's design and description (`A cursed crown once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` - [Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen)), and negation of dealt damage to fiends due to damage penalty.

    As it has design of [Valkyrie Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail), but with the resistance to fire grater than higher-grade [Heavenly Iron Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor): `It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire`, we can suggest 2 potential explanations for its properties:

    - Its strong resistance to fire is the result of its fiendish nature, the process of aligning to Underworld, similar to fiery nature of Lord Vanaduke after being cursed by Vog. This interpretation can stem from biblical moif of the description, linking Underworld to fire.
    - Enchanced resistence to fire may be a result of the armor being of the same grade as [Heavenly Iron Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor), which would coincide with the degree of punishment of that Valkyrie.

    Given context of [Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen), its halo being an inversion of [Valkyrie Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm), as well as its resistances, we suggest fire resistence being a result of being cursed, alluding to the first explanation of _Underworld being metaphysically linked with fire_.

- `A cloak for renowned Owlite scholars, this feathery frock is filled with the wisdom of the ages` ([Grey Feather Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle)) is _resistant to fire and shock_.
- `A heavenly cloak thought to be once worn by celestial sages` ([Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle)) is _resistant to fire and shock_, as well as curse, characterised by its name.

    It is the only cloak in alchemy tree that is resistant to shadow damage instead of elemental among equipment directly linked to Owlites.

- `A resplendent replica of the shield thought to have been issued to the most eminent of Owlite wizards. Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` ([Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)) is _resistant to both fire and shock_. The owner of this shield will concern us later.

    It is one of 2 shield having same resists, the other being [Crest of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire). Crest of Almire being an interpretation of Almire by Spiral Order may be a reason for its defenses. It can also be the case of [Miracloth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracloth) providing shock resistances, given its description: `A marvelous bolt of sublimely supple fabric`.

    The `righteous` characteristic of Grey Owlite Shield is similar to [Seraphic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphic_Mail): `A beautiful mail coat that causes its wearer to strike out at evil with righteous fury`. We know that Owlites were annihilated by the Kataclysm due to Kat Tribe's activity, and this is a solid reason for Owlite to hold feelings of vengeance.

    These properties of fire and shock resistences establish those Owlite armors as more advanced compared to Valkyrian divine armors.

- `An upgraded set of Silvermail that is said to shine brightly even in the darkest of hours` ([Radiant Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail)). It has [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather) used in its alchemy and is an upgrade of 4-star [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail): `Strong, yet light armor for knights who've sworn an oath to hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk`.

    Here we will attempt to pair `said to shine brightly even in the darkest of hours` of [Radiant Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail) with the description of Underworld, predominantly due to themes of light, divinity and prio upgrade - [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail), - referring to undead directly: `hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk`.

    A peculiar element to those recipes consists _of a lack of_ [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe), compared to other valkyrian armors, implying a lack of connection to the Legion of Ur and the time it was sealed, alluding to, potentially different prediod of time, existing before Legion of Ur was defeated or sealed.

    Mention of `knights` and of `oath` is similar to Guardian's Oath of Spiral Order, but also to [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk): `A shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power, it's said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement`, - __presenting a concept of handgun-wielding knights__, which had knowledge of undeath and potentially Underworld.

This _theme of light and opposition to the undead_ is similar to Gilded Griffin's description: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld` ([Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin)), potentially referring to the same period of time, - one, when Valkyries had invaded the Underworld.

We believe, this presents a plausible case of those __knight being the Gunslinger Priests__, which are established first in [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix): `A mysterious antique with a brilliant silver finish, these handguns are said to have been wielded by 'gunslinger priests' during a now forgotten time`. This is as the motif of priesthood presents itself fittingly with the rest of themes regarding existing threat and presence of undead and Underworld. This idea connects most of [Antigua's alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua#Alchemy_Path) to this group of knights and a period of time referred as the `forgotten time`: `A mysterious relic from a forgotten time` ([Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua)). With this, we will label this potential period of time as the _Forgotten Time - a time when gunpowder was actively used and, as it seems, there was no knowledge of greater Underworld, while the undead were an relatively known concept_.

While this does not allow us to identify Valkyries as a species, we now came across this period of time, which, weather or not would be able to provide physical evidence of preceise nature of Valkyries, contrary to themes, should be examined in terms of the timeline.

At that, we should also acknowledge now _emerging motif of handguns_, paired with close similarity of Valkyrian armors to Isorans, as well as presence of celetial naming convention - as those are _arguments in favour of Valkyres being Isorans_.

##### Silvermail

Now for the properties of [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail) and its 5-star variant. We have previously pointed out a otif of light and radiance in relation to [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin): `golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`. Due to those themes of shining and radiance, as well as an association with dragons, we are considering to pair above items together not in a set, but _equipment from different faction at the same period of time and environment_, a distinct association of [Antigua-based handguns](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua) with [Gunslinger Sash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash) there exists. It is also here should be noted, that [Gunslinger Sash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash) mentions the forgotten time, too: `Clothing worn by pistol-packing warriors from a forgotten time. They smell of rawhide, gun smoke and action` ([Gunslinger Sash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash)).

Then it is [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix), despite the cultural references of handguns, under above logic of parity of 5-star light-themed variants to be paired with [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail), as both are _referring to knights who opposed Undead_ as the supposed Gunslinger Priests:

- `A mysterious antique with a brilliant silver finish, these handguns are said to have been wielded by 'gunslinger priests' during a now forgotten time` ([Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix)).
- `Strong, yet light armor for knights who've sworn an oath to hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk` ([Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail)).

##### Definition of Divinity and Celestial Beings

Aforementioned connection of Owlites to Valkyries through common themes, does not explain the reason behind of Valkyries being called the celestial beings, and their nature at that.

It can be understood through the same lens of biblical lore, same as [Armor of The Fallen](), by linking Valkyries to Angels in their heavenly kingdom, even using the term of celestial beings, applicable to celestial entities, referenced in cases, such as [Seraphic Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphic_Mail): `A beautiful mail coat that causes its wearer to strike out at evil with righteous fury` - of _celestial seraphim in presence of God_.

Owlites in that context completely lack any of those characteristics, only approaching it through the [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle), referring to Owlites as the `celestial sages` (`A heavenly cloak thought to be once worn by celestial sages` - [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle)). In this case the celestial property and divinity are present _to the point of protection from curse_, as well as potentially linking Owlites to Valkyries as not identical species, but ones possessing a celestial property.

In the recipe of [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle) there is [Silverweave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave), and, as it is described as `length of understated cloth intricately interwoven with precious metal. It's tastefully ostentatious, yet prudently protective` ([Silverweave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave)), we suggest that to some degree, [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver) is what grants it its divine or celestial properties, further affirming themes of divinity.

This connection of __divine and celestial seems as an interchangeable term in opposition to shadow damage and Underworld__, is [reminiscent of the primordial elements represented by dragons](#dragons). There we have connected divinity of _divine drakon and hypothesized divine dragon to elemental damage through concept of storms_. But in case of both Valkyries and Owlites, divinity for the most part is characterized by _piercing damage in offense_, shadow damage defense, and in lesser manner elemental damage both in defense and offense. Contary to Valkyries, it is Owlites, who were known to focus on elemental defense adn offesne, as suggested by the [Owlite Wands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Wand): `They say the wand chooses the wizard, so don't let this one see your cute friend`, corresponding with fantasy themes of Harry Potter setting.

We have to point out that all 5-star upgrades of [Magic Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magic_Hood) contain elemental defense. At that, __elemental damage is most prominently characterized as magic__. Given context of Chaos Cloak, could it be, that elemental damage is at the foundation of the divine through the connection to the [Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm), and _due to which it is characterized both divine and magical_? So far we have not much arguments to affirm it, but, we will return to this concept, once we have more information on Kat Tribe.

During Academy's continuous operation, Owlites had likely discovered an elemental realm, labeling it as the Nameless Realm (`A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` - [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak)) seemingly by the knowledge and Underworld materials acquired by Valkyrian incursion in to the Underworld, as they are used in the recipe of Chaos Cloak, such as [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe).

And as all of Owlite equipment of that alchemy tree has elemental defense, __discovery of Nameless Realm seems as a major point in their understanding of the Universe__. At that we still do not know, weather Owlites have derived most of elemental gear from this discovery, or the discovery of a separate realm has followed later? As of currently, Owlite academy was experimenting with many elements, which, compared to the valkyrian army, led to Owlites' academy uniforms being protected from both fire and shock.

With those working assumption we can begin building a vague timeline of a Forgotten Time, wherein:

1. There would be Wardens.

    Wardens are to be transformed into trojans.

2. Valkyries, as celestial beings, either have started from fighting undead, transitioning to fighting fiends in the Underworld utilizing elemental damage for hunting undead and piercing damage for fiends.

3. A period of Gunslinger Priests would establish a bridge between themes of fighting Undeath to opposing Underworld with piercing damage.

Above scenarios involve a starting event, which would allow for this potential progression to happen, including the event of Isorans transforming to trojans as a major event, which would narratively tie with trojans accompanying Lord Vanaduke and being hunted by Valkyries.

So far we lean to an idea of Gunslinger Priests, branch of elemental damage, including [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger), to be a later development, derived of Owlite research around elemental magic and sorcery (`An enchanting hood for knights who dabble in divination and contemplate conjuring` - [Magic Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magic_hood)), as _those carry imagery only existing in the Underworld_ - of an eye, meant to symbolize curse. In that context, Avanger bridges a thematic gap from, potentially Forgotten Time and Gunslinger Priests to proper establishment of the events _leading up to Valkyrian invasion of Underworld, which would require us to identify Valkyries as Owlites_.

While we have left relation of Owlites and Valkyries to celestial and angelic beings, [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx), despite being a Kat-like battle sprite, has theme of divinity and skill labeled Angelic Aura, which can be turned into Seraphic Aura and Valkyrian Aura. This further links themes of the divine with Valkyries, despite those being manifested as an reincarnation of a Kat species from a battle sprite.

Due to aforementioned discrepancy of [Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiment_(Costume)): `A long, flowing battle garb best accessorized with a pair of angelic wings`, for a supposed anatomy places valkyries as separate from Owlites, as the latter already have large wings, we would propose, that the description of [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin): `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld` allows for a different species to exist, which are __griffons - semi-draconic ancestors or Valkyries, evolving from wyverns__. Within this logic we do not know weather Owlites are descendants of Valkyries, but in order to account the transitional period of the designs, we would consider Owlites to be Valkyries.

This trajectory would allow to not only make a correspondence to tortomega, tortoises, drakes and dragons, but allow for the thematic discrepancies within heavenly kingdom, reminiscent of stone and mecahnical devices of tortomega.

#### Owlite Research of Undeath

Owlites also have researched ancient power of wind frenzy, finalized in the invention of the [Turbillion](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Turbillion), as suggested by presence of the [Owlite Feathers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Feather) in its alchemy.

Owlite more magic-directed armor and shields were designed to protect against specifically those elements, such suggesting alchemy tree of the [Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield): `A sturdy shield similar to the sort said to have been carried by Owlite youth`. Alchemy tree of [Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield), as well as many other Owlite, Valkyrian and Kat Tribe items have fiendish [brimstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brimstone). As this is a material found in the Underworld-adjacent locations, it can also be attributed to a later period of time.

Alchemy at that point has also been a commnly known principle, as its symbol, or rather symbol of alchemy orb, [is depicted](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/images/9/92/Divine_Tome_of_Rage-Equipped.png) on the [tome of rage front cover](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_rage).

This relates us back to the previous concept of alchemy and energy being universal, unless, Spiral Order managed to pass this knowledge, before becoming trojans, or if Valkyries are Isorans - an idea we propsed due to similarity of the designs, - as they are known to master alchemy for a long time, discussed in [technology of Isorans](#technology-alchemy-and-Isoran-redesigns): `Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries` ([Alchemy for Beginners](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners)). We have to also consider that this tome is likely far older than most of Owlite civilization, as it was originally in the [Rage Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Prize_Box), which had relation more so to Valkyries, than modern Owlites.

#### Forgotten Time

There exists a griffin-like species, as described by the [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin): `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`, yet, on the handgun itself there are dragons depicted, and only [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) and [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza) alchemy paths have a creature with a beak.

Here, [Raptor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raptor), a predecessor of [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) is also designed with dragons and meant for ventures into the Underworld: `An ancient pistol imbued with enchantments designed to smite the fiendish creatures of the Underworld` ([Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin)).

The key 2 elements of this branch of Antigua alchemy tree are the _draconic design_ and _direct creation of the handguns to fight fiends of the Underworld_ as evident by their description, linking dragons to peircing damage, as wel las introduce griffins as an ancient species with similar cultural principles.

Those who wielded those handguns, did witness the Underworld and likely ahd descended there. At that griffins had existed _in order to assign them those characteristics_ of light and radiance. In that regard, the change from raptor to griffin may be due to a reason currently unknown.

We must reinstate a similar design in the Spiral Order battle sprite menu, where in_2 dragon heads_ are depicted, __reminiscent of the arches of Scarlet Fortress__, belonging to heavenly kingdom. This ties in with seemingly mythological position of dragons in Isoran culture, covered ealier in relation to their armors. And if so, this pattern being applied to Antigua-derived handguns, seems us as an argument for a proposal, that __both civilizations are united by the common themes, designs, and motifs__.

Then there are Antigua upgrades with imagery of a bird:

- `these handguns are said to have been wielded by 'gunslinger priests' during a now forgotten time` ([Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix)). The theme of divinity connected to those priests here was linked to [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail).
- `Its bullets serve as ushers for those that refuse to leave this world` ([Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker)). It is an upgrade of [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix), and serves the same purpose to combat undead, with a distinguishing description of them being: `those that refuse to leave this world`.

  Owlite [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather) in its crafting is notable, either being created by Owlites, or is the assumption of an existing thematic link between Valkyries and role of Owlites.

  As it is an upgrade of a handgun, denitely weilded by Gunclinger Priests, we can assume this gun was, too, engineered for the same purposes.

- `A shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power, its said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement` ([Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk)). This handgun in particular has a few elements to it:

  - It was wielded by a knight, we keep in mind knight which were wearing [Silvermail](): `Strong, yet light armor for knights who've sworn an oath to hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk`, allowing for a new link between knights and handguns.
  - The [haunting](#haunting) as a tangible process, exists with involvement of souls bound to physical objects. In similar manner, souls are bound to skulls and [masks](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-span-classthrough-cursethrough-cursespan).
  - The `shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power` wording states the nature of the handgun, as it deals shadow damage, but also suggests that shadow damage is that `incredible power`, considering this damage type being far more unnatural compared to the rest, which is fitting for modern Isorans: ` powerful handgun brimming with dark energy. The Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research` ([Phantamos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos)).
  - The bird imagery, now identified as griffin.

- `An ancient handgun forged from shadow steel. It is said to have been wielded by an evil one who possessed "angel eyes"` ([Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza)). Shadow steel originates from the Underworld, and, as the handgun's design suggests, it was made near the same period of time as all of the above - with the hawk imagery. This notion can link this handgun to the [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen), _as equipment of Valkyrian design, yet opposing to them_. But, as the western motif is present both for armor and a handgun, it had to be accounted for.
- The [Chilling Duelist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chilling_Duelist) is of the same design as the rest of Antigua alchemy tree, with the addition of ice, which may be attributed to elemental materials the gun is alchemized from. It is acquired from the [Deluxe Starter Pack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deluxe_Starter_Pack), which also contains [Tri-Guard Set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tri-Guard_Armor): `A special suit of armor designed specifically for knights on first recon of alien planets. This rugged suit protects against a variety of harsh elements`. The armor seems more medieval compared to the rest, which might _attribute it to an earlier period of time of Isoran history_ so slightly.

It seems to us clearly, that Valkyrian society, culture, customs, traditions and beliefs, reflected in their designs, __are identical to ones of Isorans of Spiral Order__. Given later motif of Isorans as guradians against danger of darkness, Sleeper spoken of, we can further _tether two civilizations_, weather or not those were the same species.

Considering the thematic element to gunslinger sets and Antigua alchemy tree, as they explicitly refer to a forgotten time, we have to examine 2 scenarios:

- Isorans were already familiar with the Underworld, and had forgotten of it as Spiral Order. They would also forget elemental damage, as it is one introduced currently by Owlites under interrpretation of Isorans being separate species from Valkyries.
- As [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger) is alchemized from the Sealed Sword, which is exchanged for Slime Token, same as [Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua), whose alchemy tree refers to a forgotten time and seem to belong it: `A mysterious relic from a forgotten time`, we have to link _Forgotten Time to be specifically characterized by Gunslinger Priests_.

At that, presence of western-themed equipment makes it more nuanced regarding the identity of gunslinger priests during the Forgotten Time. We return to the potential of Isorans being involved in this distinction of griffin and dragon-like designs of handguns, as the potential catalyst for those events for Valkyries.

##### Gunslingers From Isora

It is evident that at least [gunslinger sash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash) and [Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua) are connected. Both have a reference to a forgotten time and both being low-tech equipment from a different time.

This makes it seem that Forgotten Time is referring to Isorans mainly due to occasional mention of knights and general thematic attribution of guns to Spiral Order rather than valkyries. __In this interpretation forgotten time presumes Isora  to be the setting before establishment of Spiral Order__.

Two questions emerge for this interpretation:

- If spirits are known to return to material realm _as an unnatural phenomenon_, how undead managed to exist on Isora, unless it has similar metaphysic properties to Cradle?

    If it is on Isora, [and as we had discussed](#cradle-metaphysics) a potential case of Core only allowing for spirits to return _in large scale_, the rest of those laws would remain the same and localized to specific phenomenon involving Underworld's presence. But, this suggestion still would not explain the reason why modern Isorans would forget an entire realm, while interacting with its physics on their supposed homeworld.

- Relation between Underworld and griffins remains unknown while dragons were established to be present on Isora.

    At that, angelic motif in Sentenza's description then becomes unrelated to the [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen): `It is said to have been wielded by an evil one who possessed "angel eyes"` ([Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza)), which makes the cultural refernce not being reflected in-universe.

    This popular culture-based explanation, we believe, should be able to function within the in-universe narrative by coupling armor and a handgun. If we attribute those items to Valkyries, we would decouple thematically grouped equipment to 2 different civilizations.

Valkyries are brought up here due to the most interaction with Underworld. Presented designs for the most part of the item roster _do not fit to the divine themes of valkyries_. Then it should be __Isorans, whose past was forgotten__ and who had to wield such equipment, as seen by mastery of guns amongst Spiral Order, as well as mention of forgotten time only in descriptions, alluding to the prior concept of those being written by Spiral Order.

There must be a _reason behind this time being labeled as forgotten_. It can be attributed to a sheer timescale Isorans have existed as a spacefaring civilization, as evident by gear of [Equinox Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box) described in the [spacefarers of old section](#spacefarers-of-old):

- `A special suit built to commemorate Isoran starfarers of old` ([Celestial Nav Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Suit)).
- `This suit was once worn by Isoran starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` ([Stellar Sentinel Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit)).

We can propose, that, as Isorans have existed for so long, they forgotten both elemental and shadow damage prevalent in the less technologically advanced era to how alchemy is a tool, while occultism and magic in the modern world are not widely known, being lost knowledge.

But there is also a different interpretation. If gunslingers are Isorans, this would mean that they had interacted with Underworld, which would not be forgotten as long as species exists, as seen by previous iteration of Underworld interacting with the material realm. Shadow damage in that regard remains more as vague as it was for other civilizations when compared to definitive state of elemental damage as thoroughly studied and attributed to base alchemical elements as status effects.

The lack of awareness of Underworld for modern-day Isorans makes it seem to us that they did not encounter Underworld. But, _as we discussed_ [earlier](#spiral-wardens-and-trojans-similarity-part-1), __Spiral Wardens are ones to be the foundation for the trojans of the Legion of Ur__, so at some point a _prolonged connection was established_. At the same time Valkyries are required to seal those trojans, connecting Isorans to Valkyries.

There is also Fallen Valkyrian, whose deeds had him banished (`A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` - [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen)). Due to that we see a connection between all of 3 parties:

- Isorans would encounter Underworld by the time of Spiral Order or at least Spiral Wardens were present, as Wardens were transformed into trojans, a phenomenon observed for Arkus.
- Trojans are sealed in the Underworld by Valkyries. Trojans are created from Wardens by Underworld.
- Underworld remains unknown to Skylark crew and Isorans in general.
- Fallen Valkyrian somehow involved with those events. Given our proposal of [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe) significance to Valkyrian recipes, Fallen Valkyrian has all of chances to be involved in this plot, weather or not Fallen was one of the same species to Isorans, the punishment would follow.

Here, this connection is probable through the alchemy path of Gilded Griffin, as its wielders had potentially been in the Underworld, as implied by the myth of a griffin shining a light on the Underworld.

Considering knights had remained as such, named as knights, the change in design of their military units under this narrative seems unlikely, leaving a room for Spiral Wardens, or simply wardens, to exist so far in the past. The prior idea could be also supported by the more medieval design of tier 1 trojans, where we discussed the usage of redwood in their armor.

This proposal still would not explain the state of spirits in material realm on Isora and a lack of connection to the Underworld, but, it presents a [weird west](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdWest) __setting for gunslinger priests, which seems extremely fitting__. _It is due to this thematic consistency, presence of Isorans should be accounted for_.

##### Pre-Cradle Scenario

A variation of this proposal that explains gunslingers' nature, but also presence of undead and fiends - is the pre-Cradle scenario, wherein gunslingers are from a planet, which was used to build Cradle, and the one, [where the kingdom of Almire would fall](#chapter-vii-kingdom-of-almire).

_It characterizes western-themed gunslingers, as separate from gunslinger priests, to Isorans_, but allows for them to encounter Underworld. It is the case of Isorans arriving at the same planet where Almire and Raiders would be present, as civilization, emerging from those first-generation Isorans, while still allowing a room for their transformation to trojans.

Presence of fiendish technology or magic, such as the [Blackened Shrine](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), would only be fitting, as this would be framed as a continuation of myths, found across Isoran culture even in modern times, potentially originating from Isora, such case being [Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm): `this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass`.

This case would require elaboration on [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza), as presence of shadow steel would seal a connection of material realm and Underworld in relation, now, to Isorans. If so, [Shadowsun set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowsun_slicker) and its usage of shadow steel is paired with other shadow-aligned equipment, perpetuated by the Fallen Valkyrian in means of introducing shadow damage and resources from the Underworld.

To those shadow-aligned guns we have attribute [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk), in this context, it would suggest, that this alignment to shadow was more widespread than it seems (`A shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power, its said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement` - [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk)).

On the contrary, [Deadshot Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadshot_Mantle) has shadow defenses, but is not attributed to any fiendish entity, having divine color scheme. _It also has curse resistance_. Its description, `A poncho for a pale rider with sights set on taking down the bad, ugly, undead denizens of the dark` - we suspect, refers both to undead and fiends, making it the set, plausible for pairing with [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) _alchemy line_: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`. Given prior discussion on presence of both motifs to this handgun, this seems to be a transitory point, alluding both to Valkyries and Isorans as ones to meet each other diring Forgotten Time.

Apart from the color scheme, [Deadshot Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadshot_Mantle) design is reminiscent of [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle), with both labeled as mantles, and not ponchos or cloaks. At that, one more similarity exists between them, of the circular spiral imagery:

- [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Divine_Mantle-Equipped.png) has on its front has 2 spiral circles at the bottom of the garb's symbol.
- [Deadshot Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Deadshot_Mantle-Equipped.png) has the same as above spiral circles but at the bottom front of the mantle instead of the garb.

So far, the __keystone design element to this distinction is tied to 2 groups of handguns__:

- Handguns with the __depiction of dragons__ are _relating to Isoran culture_, those are regular knights. Divine aspect here is linked to the lesser celestial motif of Isoarans.
- Handguns with the __depiction of griffins__ are a _product of Valkyrian culture_ and connected to dragons' descendants, griffins.

This distinction reminds us of [different depictions of the evil eye](#evil-eye) by Devilites and Titans.

##### Valkyrian Gunslingers

As many promotional items are seen in the context of Spiral Order and Isorans equipping them, same can be told of gunslinger items.

At the same time, no piercing damage weaponry currently exists, which could be attributed to valkyries, assuming, they had both close and ranged combat techniques.

In this interpretation [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger) had to be created already with the knowledge of curse and of sealing, to be utilized to fight undead. Since Valkyries are ones to seal Legion of Ur, we can position this skill at least by that that moment in the timeline.

But, since [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) also transmuted from the [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword), we suggest it being created later into the timeline, while it still belonging to Fallen Valkyrian, potentially placing him to that period of time, but before the Legion of Ur was sealed. This brings up an idea of [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword): `A mysterious sword of great untapped potential. It hums with raw power` being created through so far unknwon means.

This proposal leans to an idea of gunslinger priests emerging some time after introduction of Isorans, near the transformation of Warden to trojans, and before the incursion of Valkyries into the Underworld. All of those factor seem to us as follows: __Valkyries are closely related to Owlites by habitat, but through symbolism and design they resemble Spiral Order__.

#### Gunslinger Priests: Part 1

As we have exhausted here most of the leads, apart from a later period of time coinciding with the application of warding candles and fall of Owlites, we can now begin to outline a timeline by coupling majority of the inconsistencies, loose definitions, and anachronisms through common themes as the defining factor.

Forgotten time is a distinct and early period of time, involving gunslingers on a planet, where undeath would be prevalent and fought against by an established heavenly kingdom.

There were gunslingers, which were specializing in hunting those udean using primitive handguns, but with a magical capacity to greatly damage undead.

Those Gunslinger Priests are separated into 2 groups, defined by the tipe of handgun they were using - with depictions of a griffin or a dragon.

Given handgun western motif of first handguns and armor, we considering Isorans, who have crash landed on this planet, _eventually resulting in 3 kingdom emerging_, to be first guncslinger, before being established as priests nor possessing a specialized equipment to hunt undead, apart from inherited skill of weilding peircing-damage weapons, a trait, upon which modern Spiral Order is still specializing.

Before those kingdoms would be built, proper Underworld was near that time uncovered, perpetuated by exsitence of undeath on Cradle and specific customs of Isorans. Presence of Underworld was felt in the mountains which would become ones in proximity of the Great Citadle of Almire. We previously proposed, that it is connected to [magmatic fanatics](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), which were the reason for shrine's construction, which would be built eventually in the future.

But, given Lord Vanaduke's crusade did put an end to the war of 3 kingdoms, we suspect that most of this land was rendered uninhabitable. Such interpretation allows us to consider Valkyries invading the Underworld for that reason, as it was Legion of Ur and Lord Vanaduke's curse which caused this, showing the scale of destruction Legion of Ur was capable of.

This would place an incursion of Valkyries into the Underworld after kingdom of Almire had fallen. But, as this period of time was better explored, and no evidence of guns were found, we have suggested placing forgotten time eiather into far future, or into far past, before medieval themes of Isorans were properly formed as they are explored in the analysis of those kingdoms.

Currently we are following a narrative, where gunslingers were present in the past, with a few soon to be covered more magical and anachronistic motifs.

During existence of kingdom of Almire, none of those kingdoms were particularly familiar with the undeath nor shadow damage, or they did not apply it due to nature of the conflict as confined to one civilization. But, we can consider [volcanic gear](#volcanic-elements) a the argument in favour of the existence of more magic-infused gear, currently it is not important.

Now, suggesting main reson for it being inner conflicts rather than united fight against Underworld, we can expand onto the suggested roster of equipment:

- For kingdom of Ironmight: [Ironmight set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail);
- For kingdom of Almire: [Almirian Crusader Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader_Armor), [Volcanic Plate set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail);
- For gunslingers: [Antigua](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua), [Gunslinger Sash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash);
- For raiders: [Squall Caller](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Squall_Caller), [Winter's Edge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winter%27s_Edge).

Through currently unknown means, ones we attributed to specificities of Isoran burial customs - such as Reverse Arms, - Isorans did uncover Underworld and undeath, separately from their homeworld, Isora, - on Cradle.

This period of time has ended with the creation of the Legion of Ur from corrupted Wardens, which had broken Guardian Oath. Legion of Ur then had initiated a conquest into the Underworld, remaining there, but not being sealed yet: `A crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves` ([Crest of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Ur)).

Only later proper Gunslinger Priests would be etablished with introduction and development of megic on Cradle either from Valkyries, or by Isorans themselves. Weather one or the other series of events had happened, Gunslinger Priests became an organization with powers over elemental damage and reimagined piercing damage, bearing not dragons as a design inherited from Isora, but griffins, suggesting involvement of Valkyries, weather or not they were focusing on long-ranged combat at that era.

The rest of non-undead focused gear would be attributed to either, precursors to gunslinger priests comprised of Isorans, wielding [Raptor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raptor) alchemy line and [Deadshot Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadshot_Mantle), and only later Valkyries, who have remade Antigua to griffin-themed variants. Those recreations would be paired in [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail) and [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix) as definitive sets of a gunslinger priests' armor for combatting the undead, while retaining their close-combat techniques. Near that point in time Underworld would be explored properly by Valkyrie, as well as Underworld itself would begin to influence material realm once again, this time though Isorans, reminiscent of their work with Titans.

Here, [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk) and [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza) are then paired with [Shadowsun set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowsun_Slicker) through a scenario of a persistent focus of Isorans on shadow-damage due to Sentenza being attributed to Fallen Valkyrian, despite the decoupling of themes brought from the source material. As for [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza), specifically, as it is stated to be forged from shadow steel `An ancient handgun forged from shadow steel`, seems to be created in the Underworld, similar to [Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust) alchemy line: `A powerful, cursed sword forged in the underworld` (`An upgraded Faust forged from pristine-quality shadow steel. Its charge attacks are powerful enough to curse its wielder, but that hasn't stopped Devilites from treasuring these rare blades even more highly than their meager vacation time` - [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust)).

it is Isoran wardens which were the victims of this connection to the Underworld, leading to creation of Legion of Ur. And only later Valkyries would carry out their own expedition into the Underworld, one characterized, or likely, initialized by the actions of a figure of Fallen Valkyrian, now only known as the Fallen, based on the [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen). This scenario requires for early Isorans to discover shadow damage and direct connection to Underworld, as one attributed to the time period Blackhawk corresponds - the Forgotten Time.

##### Fantasy-Themed Undeath

It is during this _more fantasy_ as well as _weird western-themed_ period, the Forgotten Time, [Cold Iron Carver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Carver) and [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher) would be invented, corresponding to the themes of hunting undead, as they all have now familiar imagery of the evil eye, as well as a focus on slaying the undead: `A powerful cold iron blade forged for the singular purpose of hunting down and destroying the undead` [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher). Given its alchemy path from [Calibur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tempered_Calibur), it mirrors the same pattern of Almirian armor being a more ancient depiction of Isoran order. And it is here we attribute this blade to the same period of time characterized by this focus on more fantasy-themed appearances and undeath. But, compared to initial handguns, uch as Antigua, presence of evile eye and context of undead suggests a relatively later period of Isora existence on Cradle, corresponding to existence of Blackhawk.

Vanquisher and [Cold Iron Carver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Carver) in that regard is one with a particular imagery of __a horned skull with a single eye__, reminiscent of titans in their most powerful period of time, _depicted on the Arcade Gates_, considering, that it is a helm which was interpreted as a skull. Vanquisher's alchemy path has normal damage, but is designed to smite undead, which would also fit under the logic of early period of time, wherein normal damage would be most widespread.

Vanquisher also has chains as part of the design, which we have pointed out for Lord Vanaduke's armor, a discussion, relevant for the context of [his armor being considered a prison](). So, those design to arrive from far older period of time seems as more thematically fitting, giving those element a reason to be present.

We also propose, that it is during this period of time more modern iterations of Tortomega's Troika would be invented - [Triglav](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav) as one containing Underworld's everfrost, and [Sudaruska](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sudaruska). Both are normal damage weapons, but they possess a subtle aspect of magic, similar to the aforementioned [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher).

Those weapons only could've been invented with the knowledge of Underworld, such as presence of everfrost, as well as of the awareness of previous civilization - of tortomega. in order for [Troika](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika) alchemy tree to be represented as it is.

#### Divinity and Alchemical Gold

Here we should also touch upon the small theme of gold and divinity connection:

- As [Gilded Griffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) is described: `Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`.
- _Golden_ [battle sprite harness](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Harness) deals piercing damage, but can't be equipped on Drakon, with the same damage type inconsistency of piercing damage of Morai armor and [Riftlocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker) used by the Spiral Order.

We believe, this motif is related to alchemy from the very beginning of the established divine dragons' associated elements, as gold was considered pure, divine metal, representing physical and spiritual perfection, and one, which, but on a different matter would serve on par with silver in opposition to Shadow Steel of Underworld.

And, as for the handguns of ths period of time, [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) would be invented by Owlites in their research. Owlite Academy Of Macgics were at the frontier of elemental research, which would become prominent as we will cover the Fallen Valkyrian.

All of those similarities make it seem for us as if all those cultures were deeply intertwined at some point in time, in the similar manner to the existence of [heavy statues](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Statue#Heavy_Statue). This would resolve both in-game status resistances, as an argument for physiological similarities, and also symbolic and thematic parallels.

#### Celestial Kingdom

One last suggestion, which could back this convoluted chain of event, a potential explanation for the identity of heavenly kingdom, is the inspiration by the Celestial Kingdom of Chinese Mythology.

Celestial kingdom is ruled by the Jade Emperor. Queen Mother of the West is the guardian of souls, of the spiritual realm, and represents the balance of nature. This description is most reminiscent of the Spirit Mother. Within the Celestial Kingdom reside spirits, which is similar to our understanding of the Nameless Realm, albeit with western alchemical ideas.

There are the Four Heavenly Kings. Despite the title, they are guardians of Heavens, protecting the Celestial Kingdom from even entering. [Oni Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm) has similar description of a fiend: `Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass`.

Those similarities seem intentional, distinguished from the general themes and motifs across many different Myths, apart from Christianity, which, as will will further discuss, has its prevalence. This, we believe, still marks a distinction between physiology of celestial beings in the context of Spiral Knights, and ones within the material realm, extrapolated onto many different species.

More so, we have previously covered divine themes of Valkyries through relation to wording of seraphic or angelic, suggesting a transition from the divine to material.

Considering that, as well as our previous discussions of Valkyries being griffins, a solution could be proposed, that Owlites identical to Valkyries in the material realm, and Valkyries are only referred as such by being an army of heavenly kingdom.

By that time Owlite academy is to be established and used to create elemental gear for gunslinger priests, as well as making greater accent on magic and power of sealing the curse. This would lead Legion of Ur being sealed at least after Lord Vanaduke's crusade.

#### Knights of the Rose

One of the last remaining elements of this forgotten time, we propose, are the Knights of the Rose. Their nature-themed design and naming is present as one other instance from a similar period of time of medieval Europe.

Knight of the Rose are described in the [Tabard of the Rose](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tabard_of_the_Prismatic_Rose#Tabard_of_the_Prismatic_Rose): `An aged, embroidered tabard that once belonged to a Knight of the Rose, a sacred order of brave and especially dashing heroes whose numerous adventures are the subject of many folk tales. The Knights of the Rose were said to be peerless fencers, believing that their blades were like the flowers of their name: a delicate thing of beauty that hides a vicious sting`.

As they are described as fencers, the only equipment that could potentially fit to them is the [Flourish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flourish) alchemy tree.

The [Fowl Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fowl_Cloak) of [Rooster Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rooster_Prize_Box) is the bringing element to tabards and Strangers as it has the same pattern weaved on cloth as a few Haven canopies ([Fowl Set pattern](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Brown_Fowl-Set.png)).

Similar to the cloak, [tabards of the rose](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tabard) of [Rose Regalia Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rose_Regalia_Prize_Box) and a [letter](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95665). It is important to note meaning of tabard - a type of coat being worn in late middle ages Europe, used both in and out of military context.

Fencers' armor designs are similar to Fowl's which are the same as the patterns on canopies across [Haven](#strangers-and-haven). This fact, as well as nature motif of knights of the Rose, we believe, makes it seem that knight of the rose were Almirians.

The question is, how Vaelyn, for example, had in her possession her Grand Flourish and Final Flourish?

An explanation can be presented here, as with gunslingers and regular close-combat knights, their weapons, their designs, fencers were also present on Isora with the rest of first generation of Isorans, but only after crash landing they attained the distinctive natural theming, reminiscent of kingdom of Almire.

The fact that Stranger have those designs prior to arrival of Spiral Order during present events is important, as it suggest that a large period of time has passed since. Otherwise there would be no reason for Spiral Order to take Strangers' designs as the basis for tabards', including their framing as something coming, yet again, from the past.

#### Fallen Valkyrian

We propose Fallen Valkyrian is one responsible for the creation of Legion of Ur in the first place, and the reason why heavenly kingdom had invaded Underworld.

While we do not know the reasoning behind those actions, we are indirectly understand, that it is those actions had led to his banishnment.

We have to also consider this case being a most direct instance of a biblical motif, among which we find banishemt of Adam and Eve, as well as banishement of Lucifer from paradise to be cases which we had to look at for potential narrative inspiration as explnation for Fallen's motivations. Here, we suggest, the resolution is rather linear - as Fallen's armor became associated with Underworld, shadow damage, and curse, we suspect him to be a stand-in for Lucifer's banishment from Heaven.

Based on the designs of the armor, and its recipes, we can attempt to piece together what happened back then:

- `A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` ([Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen)).
- `A cursed crown once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` ([Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen)).

The `celestial` characteristic is one used to refer to valkyries in the [Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) description: `A powerful helm said to be crafted from angelic shields. It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire`.

The paradise in that regard, as it takes more religious connotation, is the heavenly kingdom, the Scarlet Fortress being what remains of it. And it seems to us fitting from current themes, that this narrative parallels to a religious one. With this, __this heavenly kingdom, or paradise, and Valkyries' Asgard, seem to be located in a realm above material realm, while allowing more matter from the material realm, as castles, comprising the kingdom__.

In that context, [Sentenza](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza), as it is forged from Shadow Steel, seems to belong to the Fallen Valkyrian instead of the Shadowsun set. This would decouple it from the [Shadowsun Slicker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowsun_Slicker), which is an issue, but, we can potentially attribute [Blackhawk](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk) to this set.

We have a reason to consider the aforementioned heavenly kingdom as one located in a different realm due to the multi-dimensional property of the proposed cosmology - so that a biblical event, such as banishment of the Fallen, would involve at least 2 realms. And given lack of presence of material realm, and opposition of the latter 2, it seems that there are 3 dimensions to be involved in this conflict.

As Fallen was banished into the Underworld, Valkyries had head an incursion into Underworld, and then sealed both the Fallen and the Legion of Ur (`Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back` - [The Return of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur)). [Crest of Ur](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crests_of_Ur) contains an addition to this hypothesized timeline of events: `A crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves`, in which we linked sound of drums to the sound of drum during Lord Vanaduke's transformation: `With this he began screaming the names of the rival kings and all the wrongs they committed against his kingdom. He cried out to the god of the mountain to punish them, to give him the strength to take his kingdom back. In his frenzy he looked to the face of the deity and in it he began to see the face deform. The image burned into his eyes and brain like cinders, and contained that which sounded like the screaming of foreign tongues and war drums` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), as __war drums being characteristic of Underworld's influence onto living beings__.

This Crest has 2 notable properties: the supernatural presence of trojans and the fact legion of Ur had conquered the Underworld. The supernatural presence of trojans is similar to Snarbolax's equipment curse properties:

- `Those who wield it claim to feel the fiery stare of the beast upon them whenever they close their eyes` ([Barbarous Thorn Blade](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade)).
- `Its said the beast can use the glowing orbs on the shield's face to see and stalk weak-hearted wielders`([Barbarous Thorn Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Shield))

And, as discussed in [Snarbolax and empowerment through curse section](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse), all those instances of haunting in varying severity are explained by the unnatural, from the position of material realm, properties.

It is said that the legion had conquered the Underworld, and based on the above information, was sealed there. We also concluded that it is the same army Lord Vanaduke had led when he returned from the erupting volcanic mountains.

As our theory suggests that trojans are wardens, so their arrival is fitting here, but this would also mean that one had to lead them - a lack of Legion's commander.

At that point we would suggest that this figurehead would be the Fallen Valkyrian, as this type of power shift, rippling through time, would be a reason for a banishment for the Fallen under this framing. This means that the Fallen's name is Ur once he remained in the Underworld with an identity of a commander of Underworld elite legion.

We also suspect, that, _as Arkus was transforming into a fiend, so was the Fallen_, given his affinity with fiends through armor's stats.

Apart from them, there is [Crown of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen), as it has a shadowy halo, similar to one in [Valkyrie Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm). And, as Valkyrian armors have [Trojan Horseshoe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe) as a fiendish material in their recipe, this, we suppose, points to high importance of this event of banishment and connection to the Legion of Ur of all parties from that period of time.

##### War in Heaven

One last element for this idea is the ownership of [Champion Helms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Champion_Helm) of rage, frenzy and storms. As we discussed, tortomega are unlikely candidates, but at that time no other civilization could claim ownership of the gear, apart from valkyries themselves.

And at that time they did not have any known internal conflicts. But now, as there is an event which caused a valkyrian to be banished, we can suggest that this valkyrian had its own followers, armed with such equipment. And, coincidentally, the wording - `The helm of one who defied the gods and razed the gates of a heavenly kingdom` ([Frenzy Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Champion_Helm#Frenzy_Champion_Helm)) reminds now of the Fallen Valkyrian, as one opposing heavens.

Going back to interpretation of the Fallen as Lucifer due to Underworldly alignment of the armor, one particularity catches our attension - of a war in Heaven:

<BookCitation source="Revelation 12:7-9">

Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.

</BookCitation>

Those events seem us to cincide with the potential of [Champions](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Champion_Helm#Frenzy_Champion_Helm) being within this seige of heavenly kingdom on Fallen's side:

- `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed the gates of a heavenly kingdom. Some say the thunderclaps are the eternal echoes of her siege` ([Storm Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Champion_Helm#Storm_Champion_Helm)).
- `The helm of one who defied the gods and razed the gates of a heavenly kingdom` ([Raging Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Champion_Helm#Raging_Champion_Helm)).
- `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed the gates of a heavenly kingdom. Some say that whistling wings are the eternal warcries of her siege` ([Frenzy Champion Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Champion_Helm#Frenzy_Champion_Helm)).

Notably, compared to the [creation myth](), here specifically terms of razing and storming are used in the context of destruction, which, paired with the desgins themselves, can be interpreted in strict set of scenarios. Could those helms be in a set with [Plate Mails](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plate_Mail_(special))? There exists a possibility of this being true if we take in consideration common designs of plated armors. But, as no description for those armors specifies at the same level of detail instances of an invasion, we would consider wearers of plated helms to be part of a larger group, likely an ancient Valkyrian army, given their more ancient elemental themes and designs.

### _Chapter `VIII` &#160;<br>_ Kat Tribe

The events preceding Kataclysm take place after the fall of the kingdom of Almire and sealing of Legion of Ur in the Underworld.

While tortomega or titans [are long gone](#the-titans-tortomega-the-fall), and Almire itself [had turned into ashen land](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity) with the inclusion of the former kingdoms around it, at that point only heavenly kingdom remains with inhabiting it Valkyries and Owlites. The raiders are absent at that point. In relation to [Operation Gelid](#operation-gelid-and-other-methods-of-escaping-cradle), it could be plausible for them to survive for some time in the northern regions of the planet. Given events of Operation Gelid, they too could've fallen to Underworld's influence.

Kingdom of Almire was described in multiple tomes within the established Owlite Academy of Magicks, further affirming its status as an important location for heavenly kingdom serving as a library and a research center.

The [Forgotten Library](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_tome_text_Dialogue/The_Forgotten_Library), wherein first written texts about kingdom of Almire were found by Spiral Order, is located in the halls of the High Academy of magicks, now known as the Candlestick Keep. Apart from it we are aware of the research-oriented aspect of heavenly kingdom proper, implied by existence of the [Eternal Study](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Time_Enough_at_Last-Eternal_Study.png) within the Scarlet Fortress during the events of [Time Enough at Last](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Time_Enough_at_Last).

After the events of Valkyries invading the Underworld, [without gunslinger priests](#griffin-dragon-distinction-a-proposal), many fiend-related discoveries were made, we can identify those by their recipes, which contain either undead or fiendish materials.

At some point in the past, near the period of time when gunslinger priests were established, Philoso, an Owlite magician and wizard, was born (`A large, grey feather plucked from the greatest of the Owlite magicians` [Philoso Feather](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather)). He is responsible for many developments of Owlites' research on elemental damage application in combat and defense. Evident by gear made with his [feathers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather#Usage), __he was specializing in elemental combat against the Undead__. And, we suppose he was the founder of gunslinger priests, given his significance as an individual, uncovered by Spiral Order. His position as an Owlite relates back to the relation of _Owlites and Valkyries as far descendants of dragons, wyverns, and finally griffins_, with griffins being direct ancestors of Valkyries.

We have discussed this relation in the [first intermission](#intermission-gunslinger-priests-of-forgotten-time), paralleling [relation](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans) between _dragons, drakes, tortoises, and finally tortomega_, - the latter being the civilization of titans, annihilated by Undercorp.

Those undead, against which an organization of gunslinger priests was formed to fight, were part of Underworld army during the time, labelled as forgotten, after Isorans had discovered Underworld for the first time, as Fallen Valkyrian was involved and Legion of Ur was created, as per [analysis gunslinger priests appearing in the timeline](#fallen-valkyrian).

During that period of time:

- Owlite [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle) being the result of incorporation knowledge of curse into divine aspect of Owlite elemental advancements.
- Upgraded [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_avenger) __being a prime case of negation and inversion of curse__ of Gran Faust through application of Seals.
- A handgun, [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) and entirety of griffin-themed line of handguns being developed by Owlites with assistance of Isoran gunslingers to combat undead, known as gunslinger priests.
- [Radiant Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail) and [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail) were devised to assist Valkyries in the Underworld, with Silvermail and [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix) lines of equipment being the gunslinger priests' standard equipment.
- Initial creation of [Omegaward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward) we attribute to Owlites, as no other civilization would be as skilled in elemental damage mastery as Owlites.
- [Deadly Crystal Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb) with application of Valestone mixed with Moonstone is characteristic of [Owlite-specific ritual circles, later found in the Moorcroft Manor](#moorcroft-manor-past-heavenly-kingdom).
- [Owlite shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield) and [Grey Feather set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle) being developer with the same derived oif elemental mastery knowledge by Owlites.

We propose, that exactly Philoso's research after Legion of Ur was sealed had led to the discovery of the Nameless Realm, based on the presence of Crest of Ur in alchemy of the [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak), with the subtle _imagery of the antique evil eye_, seen in [Heavy Statues, deeply related to Titans](#evil-eye). The very fact, that is is _stated to be forbidden_, seems to us as the invention too dangerous even for the heavenly kingdom. It can be argued, that Valkyrian armor also has fiendish materials, which is true, but, given presence of curse, we consider this development from later period of time, given more widespread Dread Seal symbolism around Owlites and undead.

This ties back to a specific point in time, which marks introduction of the evil eye in the form of [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal) as one applied in Owlite magic. This should align with the creation of [Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger), as it would be created from the [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword), supposedly stollen [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) (` that hasn't stopped Devilites from treasuring these rare blades even more highly than their meager vacation time` - [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust)), as it is deeply tied to curse. And, Sealed Sword was sealed with the same [paper dread seal as Lumbers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Monster-Redward.png), who, as we discussed, were constructed by gremlins, who also work with shadow damage, but to a far lesser extent.

The nature of Sealed Sword, its upgrades is one of more notable element to the nature of curse overall as well as more direct depictions of capacity and limits to transform and reapply it in same manner - like the Divine Avenger alchemy path.

Application and origin of the [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal) will be covered in consideration of Carnavons, which will be analyzed later in the context of Shadow Lairs.

After the Fallen Valkyrian was banished, after Almire had fallen, and after Legion of Ur was sealed, within this relatively stable period of time, as not much is known to happen there, _Kat tribe emerges_.

#### Siege of the Academy

Owlites are related to vengeance, which, considering their relation to valkyries, is fitting (`A resplendent replica of the shield thought to have been issued to the most eminent of Owlite wizards. Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` - [Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)).

Kat Tribe, or at least, invasion of the Academy was led by Margrel: `A reclaimed raiment that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` ([Black Kat Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment)). It is also known, that not all kats are literate: `It appears that illiteracy is still rampant among the black kat hordes, so they have once more taken to eating the pilfered pages rather than using them for arcane rituals` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025)) and `Black kats are the darkest souls of the former Kat Tribe. They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation - Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue)). _General perception of Black Kats makes impression of a metaphorical exchange of mental capacities to raw magical, or curse-driven, powers of Black Kats_, when compared to the Mewkats or [Spookats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spookat#Spookat).

Then there is an establishment of inner structure of their army during the siege of the academy:

- Frontline soldiers, "Clawers" - `An impressive mask instilled with the might of Kat Clawers, the fearsome frontline fighters of the Kat Tribe` ([Kat Claw Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Mask)) as they are referred as warriors: `A crudely crafted cloak made to resemble a cut-throat warrior of the ill-fated Kat Tribe` ([Kat Claw Cloak]( https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Cloak)).
- Grenadiers, "Seekers" - `An impressive mask instilled with the might of Kat Seekers, the skillful grenadiers of the Kat Tribe` ([Kat Eye Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Mask)), `A crudely crafted cloak made to resemble a crack shot warrior of the ill-fated Kat Tribe` ([Kat Eye Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Cloak)).
- Demolition engineers, "Hissers" - `An impressive mask instilled with the might of Kat Hissers, the unstable bombers of the Kat Tribe` ([Kat Hiss Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Mask)), `A crudely crafted cloak made to resemble a temperamental warrior of the ill-fated Kat Tribe` ([Kat Hiss Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Cloak)).
- Sappers - `A crudely crafted cloak made to resemble a shadowy sapper of the ill-fated Kat Tribe` ([Black Kat Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Cloak)).
- Sleeper cells, "Nappers" - `An impressive mail instilled with the might of Kat Nappers, the undercover sleeper cell of the Kat Tribe` ([Black Kat Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Mail)). This implies presence of Kats, as own species, among Owlites, which would be considered separate from Kat Tribe.

With this, we can identify specialists of the Kat Tribe:

- Torair, an engineer - `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Torair, who clung to the gates of the Owlite High Academy of Magicks as both it and his explosives burned` ([Kat Hiss Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Raiment)).
- Preowa, grenadier commander - `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` ([Kat Eye Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment)).
- Scraith, may be identified as a member of initial assault forces, given his equipment matching Clawers' - `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Scraith, first to scale the walls of the Owlite High Academy of Magicks` ([Kat Claw Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Raiment)).

This suggests a general plan of attack at the academy: _as explosives were planted at the front gates of the academy, it was infiltrated over castle walls, while the artillery was used to target Grey Feather Tower_.

Then, as the academy was breached, Margrel has entered the location where Book of Grey Feathers was held:

- `A cursed cowl that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` ([Black Kat Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Cowl))
- `A reclaimed raiment that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` ([Black Kat Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment))
- `A whisker won from the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel. They were traditionally worn as a ward against Owlite magics but now represent the triumph of goodly magical arts over evil` ([Wicked Whisker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Whisker))

Based on [Black Kat Raiment's design](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment) as a cursed armor, [Margrel's design](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel), [Black Kats' design](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grimalkin#Black_Kat), as well as [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx) battle sprite, we can guess approximate presentation of Kats:

- Coat pattern of [Kat Hiss Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Cowl) looks same as the siamese variant of [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Siamese)).
- Inverted color scheme of [Kat Eye Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Cowl) resembles the tabby [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Tabby)).
- [Kat Claw Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Cowl) does not have a relevant fur coat pattern for Seraphynx.

At that, we should note presence of an __antique evil eye symbolism across Kat armor__. Weather the eye symbolism has emerged during alchemy by Spiral Order or was innate property of armors as part of Kat Tribe culture, will be eventually discussed.

#### Grey Feather Tower

With, supposedly, variation of that equipment, Kat Tribe had invaded Owlite High Academy of Magicks. Discussing the Academy, one particular naming convention of _Grey Feathers_ is present there in 3 instances:

- `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` ([Kat Eye Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment)). A tower within the Academy is established.
- `A cloak for renowned Owlite scholars, this feathery frock is filled with the wisdom of the ages` ([Grey Feather Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle)) belonging to renowned Owlite scholars, likely those in the Grey Feather Tower.
- `A cursed cowl that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` ([Black Kat Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Cowl)).

We will attempt to locate Grey Feather Tower, considering the medieval castle-like theme of heavenly kingdom and of Owlites, onto the general medieval, 9-15th century castle plan with considerations of the tower's purpose. The case of Kat Tribe utilizing artillery may suggest a period of time with an upper boundary, which parallels more widespread application of artillery in sieges of castles. Due to this we should also reconsider a time period of gunslinger priests' establishment, to whom we will return later.

Under this logic we can suggest 2 places for the tower: as one to the castle's dungeon, usually the highest tower to house most of castle's army, or the central keep itself. The keep is the most protected, inner structure of the castle, wherein castle's ruler chambers, living quarters, and treasury are located. The dungeon is predominantly used as the quarters and armory for the castles army.

But, as the aesthetics of the narrative and depth-dependant design are paramount here, same as the design of Firestorm Citadel - that of the general idea of the Owlite Academy being a castle-like structure, we would not focus of this detail apart from the location of the Book of Grey Feathers, but rather relations between known items, equipment and descriptions.

Although coincidentally, the location of the academy is referred to as the Candlestick Keep, which may potentially refer to the keep of the academy being the location Knights were traversing, potentially even Grey Feather tower itself. So far we have no evidence to precisely identify its details. As there are spookats inhabiting the keep, we may suggest that the moment Kataclysm struck, those members of Kat Tribe were still in the academy.

#### Nature of Owlite Tomes

At that, considering the following events of Kataclysm, and the motif of a [single item capable of exiting in its multiple iteration through alchemy although under different names](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse), we can hypothesize, that _the Book of Dark Rituals is the very Book of Grey Feathers_, considering the scope of the effects it causes when [ill-used in the Moorcroft Manor](#moorcroft-manor-past-heavenly-kingdom).

Despite this vagueness, we can suggest, that _the location of the Book of Grey Feathers was in the Grey Feather Tower_, given its naming convention. It is then the book itself, whose nature and abilities remain unknown:

- `[Black kats] carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives` ([Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue)).
- `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires. In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, ... The residents of Moorcroft Manor would like you to retrieve the Ancient Pages of the magical grimoires that quite likely reside in the stomachs of Black Kats` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation! - Path Notes: 2013.01.30](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)).

##### Magical Auras

Based on those descriptions of Owlite tomes we can make a guess, that the auras are bound to Owlite tomes, - that the books themselves contain this raw power which can cause the Kataclysm itself: `In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that Black Kats can't read` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation! - Path Notes: 2013.01.30](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)). And, as the pages are the ones returned to Montague, it is likely the pages themselves contain the auras, but it is unknown weather the fact _Owlite text itself, the glyphs on those pages, is what grants them an aura_, attracting Black Kats, _or it is the property of the books themselves_.

We believe it is important in order to better understand the concept of auras, which we had discussed previously in the [Auras and Souls section](#auras-and-souls). Even more interesting is the property of [fiendish glyphs to possess inner power](#fiendish-glyphs). But as we see loose pages, we can see that the text is written with ink. It is here we may connect the two, as [cursed tome stand]() states: `A podium displaying an ominous tome filled with unreadable scribbles and smudged ink prints of Kat paws`, while the [Ancient Page Token](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Page#Ancient_Page) is described as: `A crumbling page torn from a long-forgotten grimoire of the Moorcroft Manor archives. The indecipherable language written upon it glows faintly in the dark as if containing power in its very words`. While it is not observed to glow in the overworld, the [promotional art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SpiralKnights_News_72.png) __confirms this__.

It is there a fiendish glyph can be seen distinctly. On the left page of the tome there [other 3 fiendish glyphs](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Furniture-Cursed_Tome_Stand.png). Notably, the glowing glyph seems to be placed into a triangle and circled by a circle, reminiscent of the _circled square_ - the symbol of philosopher's stone.

It seems to us certain, that the __power of tomes, seen as auras, is contained in the text glyphs, inscribed on the pages__.

More so, it is the glyphs which are created from thin air in the [Sorcerer's Aura]() - as they have designs closely similar to ones of [fiendish sigils](), suggesting their existence being the foundation for magic and spells. The creation of complex circles on the ground by the aura also has close similarities to dark cities. Due to this, we propose, that __Owlites as much as devilites, were applying Underworld fiendish nature of sigils in their own means, which had led to the Kataclysm being inherently connected to undeath and Underworld__.

Then there are Moorcroft Archives, to which, we believe [Tomes on the stands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Furniture#Stands) belong.

In that regard, we can look closed at the [cursed]() and [mystical tome stands](), as they give out more information in regards to the nature of Owlite texts, and by proxy, auras.

The [ancient tome stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Tome_Stand#Ancient_Tome_Stand) may potentially belong to the kingdom of Almire, as it is the same model which is used in the final chamber of the [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum). But, that variant is surrounded by mineral circles.

Considering the interest of Owlites with the kingdom of Almire, we believe it is plausible to move the recovered texts to the Moorcroft Archives after the events of the [Legion of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire). Otherwise, this can be simply a case of asset reuse.

##### Causes of Kataclysm

Based on the [behavior](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Furniture-Cursed_Tome_Stand-Animated.png) of [cursed tome stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand), as it creates a _cursed field around itself and summons an idle spookat_, we can parallel it to the _later summoning of Margrel through the Book of Dark Rituals_, creating a __maelstrom of curse__ with the Black Kat himself:

- It is known that some time after Margrel had recovered the The Book of Grey Feathers, the Kataclysm has happened: `... the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm` ([Black Kat Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment)).

    It is plausible that the Kataclysm, as we have suggested, had originated from the Academy by the action of Margrel reading through the Owlite text, mainly due to how the Academy is covered by darkness similar to the Graveyards and so different from the Scarlet Fortress. That the source of undeath and Kataclysm's effects would've been from the similar pattern, which was initiated by the Book of Dark Rituals.
- The fact that the cursed maelstrom appears due to improper application of the Book of Dark Rituals - as suggested by [Konjuring Kat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat#Dialogue) before and after fight with Margrel: `I have no idea what might happen. It could be very bad. You probably want to be prepared in case things go... awry. ... Well, that was unexpected. I'll get it right next time!`

    We can make a guess, that the release of curse in all 3 instances:

    - By Margrel, resulting in Kataclysm;
    - By Konjuring Kat, resulting in a curse maelstrom centered around the summoning site;
    - Knight's interaction with the [cursed tome stand]();

    Are all improper, or the very state of those tomes being cursed causes this reaction of curse emerging. The latter case is countered by the fact that Margrel's book is called the Book of Grey Feathers, which, paired with Spookat warnings, is indeed dangerous.

    We still have to identify the cause and effect of those tomes, their properties.
- To add a counter point to the above discovery, the fact that [mystical tome stand]() _seems to be free of curse_.

    The interaction with it is not accompanied by curse-bearing symbolism, suggesting that it is the property of cursed tomes which summons undead kat tribe to the material realm.

    It is then a question of weather the Book of Grey Feather was already cursed, or it is the unpredictability of the magic within. If we refer to [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak) - `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all`, - the chaotic theming could be considered then as a key element to this magic as vaguely defined under terms of cursed or divine, as both represent a duality of whole.

In that context we have yet to understand, how imagery of the evil eys on Kat Tribe armors related to the metaphysics of those cursed tomes. We have notes earlier, that presence of this eye is vague, given most of the armors are transmuted through alchemy. On the other hand, the nature of [Mysterious Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mysterious_Alchemy_Machine) is by itself is a mystery. As far as alchemical recipes allow, the knowledge of that equipment may be external, and then, canon, preserving its original design - _with the evil eye being part of the original design_.

##### Book of Grey Feathers is The Book of Dark Rituals

Here we have to argue, weather presence of multiple [Books of Dark Rituals]() is canon, as, to parallel Lord Vanaduke and his possession of Seals of Almire, -- Margrel's and Lord Vanaduke's respective boss trophy token materials is not enough from a single defeat to transmute any of thematic equipment. This seems to be the case of this method of attaining the materials to be not canon.

This idea of bosses to be found in single instances my be affirmed by the sequence adn consequences rank missions offer -- [Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay) explicitly tells of what has happened after the events of The King of Ashes: `We all sensed the moment you defeated Vanaduke. The entire citadel shook as he fell and for a moment we thought that this realm would be destroyed along with its ruler. You must be careful wandering these halls with the place coming apart like this!` ([Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court)).

It is important to the understanding of where precisely is the original book of Grey Feather located, as then the Book of Dark Rituals could in fact be the very Book of Grey Feathers which had Margrel read through, supposedly, at the top of the Grey Feathers tower. And, we propose, it would be _thematically conclusive for the book to be the tool to bring Margrel back_ through the Dark Ritual many years later.

To affirm this idea of Book of Dark Ritual being the Book of Grey Feather as a unique in its existence, suggests its rare drop rate, as if over the years, by accident, it had ended up among summoned Black Kats.

The fact that it is known as the book containing dark rituals, similar to the [cursed tome stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand), which was at some point an Owlite tome, yet is described as follows: `A podium displaying an ominous tome filled with unreadable scribbles and smudged ink prints of Kat paws`, this tome was in the possession of Kats, and, as it is stated that Black Kats are unable to read, it is either was used by different spookats, or was such before the Kataclysm. Even more important the possibility of _those Kats capable of reading it and writing there_.

If knight had no skill of understanding Owlite tomes, he would be likely to recreate ill-usage of the tome, which does not fit to the presence of the [mystical tome stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand) and its [behavior](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Furniture-Mystical_Tome_Stand-Animated.png). This pattern of magic, apart from Nature Sprite magic, in the context of the effect of the Dark Ritual is very similar to the white soul-like orbs drawn to the ritual site before the pink lightning strikes it.

On the other hand, there is no unique furniture in the [Moorcroft](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Prize_Box) or [Guild hall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Guild_Hall_Prize_Box) prize boxes, like transmuted furniture, similar to [Lord Vanaduke's Finery]() and [unlit mask](), which on their own could not exist simultaneously as discussed in the [mask and finery section](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse). There, we have proposed, that _there is only one mask of Lord Vanaduke, one in his finery with the lingering presence after his soul_. Based on this we could gather, that the cursed tome is not a unique instance, but rather a multitude of books, what is the stand is not unique in its existence, there are other cursed tomes.

Due to those factors, we propose, that the Book of Grey Feathers, as it was cursed by ill-usage and potentially other factors, is the Book of Dark Rituals, as then its rarity would be symbolically explained, as one of a kind.

The cursed tomes remain, as there is both possibility of those tomes being in possession of Kats both before their banishment, and after Kataclysm - both scenarios could explain them as follows:

- The cursed tomes are tempered by spookats of the Moorcroft Archives. Most of spookats are civil enough to run Moorcroft manor, library, with an accompanied railroad.

    There are 3 fiendish sigils depicted on the left page of the cursed tomes on the stands. This means, in conjunction with the effects of interaction with the tome, that the nature of Margrel's summoning and of spookat by the cursed tome stand is fundamentally the same.

    More so, the nature of this summoning, given presence of glyphs, and glowing text of ancient pages, may link Black Kats with Dread Seal to the summoning of sealed Legion of Ur. As Legion of Ur is summoned through the sigils and ritual circles as a last resort by devilites, we can conclude that all of those 3 instances are cases of the same metaphysical laws regarding cross-dimensional transportation.

- Kat Tribe had to know of the magical properties of Owlite tomes, and, judging by animalistic behavior of Black Kats, they would have known it prior to Kataclysm and transformation to the undead.

The fact that Seraphynx in the events of [Angels from Antiquity](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity) is found in the same chamber of an identical ritual circle as Konjuring Kat, while being located in the [Restless Railroad](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad), and as it is transformed only recently, we can propose, that this innate _Kat tribe property of seeking magic is a form of reincarnation of Kats through battle sprites_, and not characteristic of a select few member of the Kat Tribe: `I think these sprites are studying these old books. I didn't even know they could read!` ([Angels from Antiquity/Restless Railroad - Rhendon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad)).

As Spookats of Moorcroft Manor are not explicitly malevolent, the prior case of living Kat Tribe being responsible for capture of Owlite tome books seems more probable, turning them by fact of interaction to a cursed tomes.

##### Kataclysm Aftermath

Kataclysm had erased Owlites and Kat Tribe, the entire heavenly kingdom, as seen by the state Scarlet Fortress is found.

We had proposed that the Academy was at the epicenter of the Kataclysm, considering its similarity to Graveyards, which are between material realm and Underworld (`Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through. You must hurry and find the exit as fast as possible before the phantoms will awaken and stalk you!` - [Graveyard - Information Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Graveyard)).

Based on the presence of spookats across Clockworks, and more specifically, presence of spookats across castles, we can guess a potential scope of Kat Tribe operation, with Kat Tribe invading both the Academy and Scarlet Fortress which we attribute to the heavenly kingdom, if not even its capital, in the same manner as among many citadels of Almire, we can explore only the Great Citadel at the center of Almire.

In the Lockdown mode, one of the arenas - the Fortress, - is the Scarlet Fortress, and it is filled with torn pages, similar to the occasional libraries of the Kataclysm prestige missions.

This pattern of knights visiting the most important regions of civilizations may be applied to the earlier concept of the Grey Feather Tower being the center point of the Owlite Academy. Despite the fact earlier we suggested that the tower itself remain unseen, we do not know its fate. As far as the properties of cursed maelstrom go, judging by its known behavior in consideration of Grim Gates, __Grey Feather Tower could be in a different realm altogether, as Graveyards__, as the Kataclysm did not erase Kats, but seemingly banished them into Underworld, while the rest of the Academy may be more intact, - anchored to the material realm.

##### Dark Ritual and The Nefarious Imp

We have stated earlier that the behavior of [Cursed Tome Stand](), presence of 3 fiendish sigils and summoning of Margrel [are of the same nature]().

Then we have added to this pattern the Legion of Ur, as its summoning is also achieved over [fiendish ritual circles](#summoning-from-underworld). Trojans are summoned through fiendish sigils and ritual circles while being banished, disallowing any other method of summoning.

As Margrel and other Black Kats are summoned through the dark ritual, one party or at least one metaphysic law is applied in both cases. While Konjuring Kat may have summoned Margrel by accident, _this is unknown of the other Black Kats, and is seemingly a desired outcome_: `A terrifying swarm of black kats came out of some dark portal deep within the Clockworks and have raided the Moorcroft Archives!` ([Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke)), `Someone or something has summoned a horde of cursed black kats into the Clockworks. These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)).

Considering the lack of relation of Konjuring Kat to devilites, and as those parties are not seem to be interacting, we can make a guess that is is the universal law of material realm and Underworld relation itself what is seen here, but used by different parties - the summoning of banished - to Underworld, likely, - entities through the usage of ritual circles.

With this, we come to find a single inconsistency and one loose end: the dark portal from which Black Kats are summoned then could be either the one which uis similar to Pembrooke's - of a cursed maelstrom, or, as he did it by accident, a dark portal of grim gates, as that actor still remains unknown.

And yet, in both cases it is the same physical law, one we gave discussed for the first time in the [analysis of Grim Gates' portal collapse](#grim-gates-portal-collapse).

The only entity that would be interested in bringing Underworld closer to material realm would be the Nefarious Imp, which we had suspected to be one who was actually seeking for the Book of Dark Rituals, based on the word "nefarious" used in both instances: `An ancient grimoire filled with unspeakable eldritch rites. Just like any cursed tome, there is likely some twisted individual out there who wants it for extremely nefarious purposes` ([Book of Dark Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals)). There is also [Warmaster Rocket Hammer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warmaster_Rocket_Hammer): `Designed by Warmaster Seerus himself, this nefarious gremlin weapon is equipped with a rocket engine that can launch the wielder forward with a powerful hammer smash`, but it seems a coincidence here, rather than an intentional choice.

Black Kats are described as `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and are making another attempt to execute their nefarious plans. ... It appears that illiteracy is still rampant among the black kat hordes, so they have once more taken to eating the pilfered pages rather than using them for arcane rituals` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025)) and `It seems the hordes of black kats have eaten their fill of magical pages, and they’re disappearing back into the shadows` ([Katastrophe Box Extended!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025#comment-914427)). The fact Kats disappear into shadows, may be of the same nature as of _Grimalkin disappearing into shadows_ and also that they willingly disappear, rather than through banishment as Legion of Ur.

In that regard Dread Seal, the one also present on Carnavons is of greater interest. It is present on entities which seemingly remained in the material realm - Carnavons. Those also have a drawn curse symbol on their crests, blackened crests of Almire. We will return to the dread seal and its meaning later, until then we will suffice with the conclusion that dark ritual in question is the part of a connection between material realm and Underworld, a method to summon entities from the latter.

##### Warding Candles

At some point in time, [blue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Candle_(Blue).png) and [yellow warding candles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Candle_(Yellow).png) were developed as they are widespread within the Academy.

As they ward off [Grimalkin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grimalkin), we can extrapolate this function onto general darkness referred in the [Information Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Candlestick_Keep): `Beware the horrible Grimalkins that lurk in the dark! These cursed wraiths cannot be destroyed and the only thing they truly fear is the light of the enchanted candles. Light them with embers and take refuge in their shining embrace`. At that point in time, smaller candles were created, designed to be carried: `A personal candle for warding off the darkness, and that which lurks within it` ([Illuminating Ward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Illuminating_Ward)).

The candles are meant to protect specifically against this threat, suggesting that the darkness was discovered before Kataclysm - likely during the suppression of Legion of Ur, - or the Kataclysm wasn't as sudden as we have supposed so far.

At that, given major absence of shadow defending equipment from Owlites, we propose, that it is the latter scenario of the Academy being lowered into the Underworld, as Graveyards, while the rest of heavenly kingdom had to withstand an onslaught of undead Kat Tribe, as it is Scarlet Fortress which is populated by the undead. The need to develop candles swiftly, but from existing knowledge, would result in such scanraio being plasusible without conflicts.

Graveyards in that regard are interpreted as being haunted after Almire had fallen, but before candles were invented:

- As they are seen in a specific [Graveyard scenario room](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_7.png), Owlites had to traverse those grounds;
- If graveyards were haunted during existence of Almire, this would not be seemingly fitting for people of Almire to travese those, as graveyards with no darkness would not have a pecedent of candles being located there in the first place.

This creates a condition for potentially other equipment to be engineered after the Kataclysm in the same themes of combatting darkness. Yet, as Cradle already had a property of spirits returning to material realm, we would suggest that the scale this process was ongoing before was in lesser extent and scale, in order for only gunslinger priests being concerned with it.

#### Gunslinger Priests: Part 2

As we have [previously explored](#gunslinger-priests-part-1) the possibility of Valkyries fighting Undead during the [forgotten time](#forgotten-time), we can arrived to the idea of severe lack of undead presence there, with larger focus on Isoran wardens being the foundation for the Legion of Ur. Here we also have a separate period of time, but _characterized explicitly by presence of undead_.

Then there was [discovered equipment and attributed to the themes of fighting undead](#fantasy-themed-undeath), within a more fantasy, Underworld-related setting. Presence of [cyclopean skull on Vanquisher's hilt](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher) fits well with [evil eye symbolism of Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak). The description of [Cold Iron Carver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Carver), `An enchanted sword crafted from cold iron whose blade wards off the creatures of the dark` with its warding motif is also reminiscent of the [candles](#warding-candles). But, as its design and alchemy remain closely associated with Isorans, we would consider this item to belong to Isorans from the forgotten time.

Then there is [Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield), which is explicitly said to belong to small few Owlite wizards. Given its divine color theme, and halo, similar to one of [Divine Veil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Veil), we can further link Valkyries and Owlites, with Philoso seemingly being present here. But, the description `Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` ([Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)) suggests, that those feelings should've occurred after the Kataclysm, as _it creates the means for Owlites' vengeance_.

It is through shield's design similarity to [Argent Peacemaker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker) we suspect, that gunslinger priests proper, as ones to possess sets of [Silvermail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail#Alchemy_Path) and [Silversix](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix#Alchemy_Path) alchemy lines, are placed here, rather then to the forgotten time. Here, [Drake Scale set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Helm), as it is related to drakes, we attribute to Valkyries near the period of time when dragons and drakes had existed, [alluding to presence of undead drakes, as howlitzers, in the heavenly kingdom and Owlite keep](#howlitzers-dragons-and-drakes).

A counterpart to the elemental line of Antigua, [Gilded Griffin]( https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin) under this logic would fall to the period of time of Valkyries invading the Legion of Ur through removal of vaguely defined events, not documented across currently existing roster of items.

Lastly, there is [Troika alchemy tree](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika#Alchemy_Path), predominantly due to its 5-star upgrades being uncharacteristic of other items in terms of design. As most of heavy plated armor has remained in possession of 3 kingdoms, we are leaning to attribute Troika upgrades to their ancestors. As [Sudaruska](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sudaruska) contains [Volcanic Iron](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron), it is more so likely to belong to ancestors of the Kingdom or Almire, per our discussion of [volcanic gear](#volcanic-elements).

Triglav, on the other hand, is acquired through participation in King Krogmo Coliseum, who is seemingly a devilite. Then, its recipe contains everfrost, a material used in Underworld's operations on containing souls. Those factors, we believe, make this sword to be made only through presence of Underworld, and paired with Sudaruska, it can plausible trace back to the period nearing the kingdom of Almire and forgotten time, when first Isoran shadow-damage-dealing gunslingers were found on Cradle.

Given nature of [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak) and Book of Grey Feathers, those items seem us to __represent the greatest advancements of Owlites__, which, consequently, had to result in a catastrophe attributed to Kataclysm and Kat Tribe.

At that, the only event remaining before creation of the kingdom of Almire is the _banishment of Fallen Valkyrian and creation of Legion of Ur_, with Gunslinger Priests being a group closely related to Isorans, their fall as trojans, and leading to the incursion of Valkyries into the Underworld.

#### Kat Tribe Artillery

There are spookats, Black Kats, and grimalkin. As with Owlites, we can only guess the anatomy of Kats based on their alchemized armor, general context, and retellings of past events in the same manner as we understood [the plan of attack onto the Academy](#siege-of-the-academy).

Kat Tribe was capable of utilizing weaponry, including artillery (`A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` - [Kat Eye Raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment)). The definition of artillery in that regard seems to not significantly differ from real-world one, as the prior carries a capacity to siege a tower of the Academy, making it powerful enough to resemble real world counterparts.

In regards to military terms, [Howlitzers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Howlitzer), we had suggested, are inspired by howitzers, a german artillery. As Kat Tribe is permanently obscured by the Kataclysm and already is associated with shadow damage seemingly earlier, could it be, that howlitzers were the units utilized during Academy's siege as the artillery? Given that howlitzer partially behave as gremlins' [homing rockets of rocket puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rocket_Puppy#Rocket_Puppy), this seems relatively plausible in the context of weaponized properties of Underworld.

As we have [proposed that howlitzer are drakes](#howlitzers-dragons-and-drakes), their existence here can only be justified by the property of spirits returning to material realm, meaning that before Kataclysm howlitzers, as drakes, had to be buried across the castle grounds of heavenly kingdom. That is, if Kataclysm is responsible for spirit returning to material realm.

In order to analyze the possibility of those scenarios, compared to our earlier suggestion of drakes invading the heavenly kingdom after dragons were defeated, we have to understand precise nature of Kat Tribe and their culture.

#### Grimalkin and Grim Convention

Regular grimalkin encountered across Candlestick Keep arrive from the darkness and vulnerable to blue warding candles. And, it is grimalkin which are referred in the candle description: `candle for warding off the darkness, and that which lurks within it` ([Illuminating Ward](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Illuminating_Ward)).

Grimalkin in real world terms is a cat. But, due to _cosmology and terminology of the setting_, we propose, that the name itself by the prefix of "grim", is meant to be associated with Underworld - grim gates, grim totems as Undercorp's or Underworld's technology, and [grim mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask) of Isoran folklore, - relates to the Underworld and its nature with close relation to darkness. This concept of dangerous darkness was earlier proposed as a [potential reason for Sleeper's concerns over it](#nefarious-imp).

Here, in the presence of Owlite Academy amd Grimalkin, the properties of this darkness are closely similar to one of Graveyard's, granting those entities - Phantoms and Grimalkin a state close to invincibility in the Material Realm, countered only by [warding candles](#warding-candles).

As warding candles are lit with embers, and Owlites are known to be vulnerable to fire, may suggest, the way we see it, that warding candles' powers are dependant on constant supply of embers and their innate properties. Considering Owlites' interest in Almire, and as we will discover in the [analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire), [heavenly kingdom surrounds the Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire), embers could in fact be derived from there. This ties with the later presence of [Dread Seals]() on [Carnavons](), populating Shadow Firestorm Citadel, but it is a different topic, which we will discuss in detail later.

As of now, __this notion of darkness makes a strong case considering it the true or close to true reason for Sleepers need in protection__ even before we properly discuss it.

Considering presence of Grimalkin only within the Academy, in addition to Margrel, we can make a guess that those are the _Kats which were at most proximity to the epicenter of kataclysm_. In order to follow the differences between origins of Black Kats, grimalkin and the rest of spookats, - as a metaphysical change had to occur to them during the Kataclysm.

##### Maskeraith

In the context of Grimalkin and here covered [phantoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom), we have to discuss [Maskeriath battle sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith).

Maskeraiths are similar to grimalkin and Black Kats in general by the fact of being ghost-like dark-colored apparitions, and morphology, similar to wraiths. The latter is important, since _grimalkin are ones to be classified as wraiths_: `These cursed wraiths cannot be destroyed and the only thing they truly fear is the light of the enchanted candles` ([Information module - Candlestick Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep#Lore)). Apart from the naming convention, spookats and grimalkin resemble undead Kat Tribe, contrasting seemingly corporeal [Seraphynx](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx). In that regard, Maskeraiths are referred by Rhedon as phantoms: `Yikes, are those the sprites or some kind of phantom? ... but there's a ghost over your shoulder! Let's hope these sprites haven't invested all their power into good looks. Use that one to clear the path ahead so a rescue team can get through safely!` ([The Phantom Mask - Creeping Cavern - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask/Creeping_Cavern)).

If _Seraphynx represents Kat Tribe before the Kataclysm_ and _Drakon of ancient dragons_, where does Maskeriath fit, or rather, __whom Maskeriath is meant to embody?__

Here we have to look at the contents of [Spritely Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spritely_Prize_Box), within which all of the rest battle sprite reskins are found. In case of Maskeriath there are 3 reskins, apart from the Grey Prize Box, which will be very important later, of [Volcanic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Volcanic)), [Freeze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Freeze)), and [Snarblepup](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Snarblepup)) variants of Maskeraith.

Phantoms and Grimalkin are similar due to being a permanent danger within Underworld darkness or proximity to it. Moreover, it is Margrel, who is transformed to grimalkin, has the same curse properties of a [phantom](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom), including the bright pink color of curse.

Phantoms have a skull with a whirling soul inside it. There are a few other instances of this design - [Estavio](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Estavio) and [Hector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hector) residing in Moorcroft manor. As we have earlier attributed this property of _souls' capacity both to linger and remain bound to its bones or item_, discussed earlier in the [context of Lord Vanaduke's passing](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse), here, Maskeraith is seemingly related to the mask, as the latter is explicitly brought up _multiple times_.

Maskeraith's mask is focused upon by [Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask/Creeping_Cavern): `
I'm curious... what do you think is behind their masks? Wait, no, I don't want to know` ([The Phantom Mask - Creeping Cavern - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask/Creeping_Cavern)), even being referred in mission's name: [The Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask). The mask is also present in Maskeraith skills, specifically, [Shadow Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Cloak_(Battle_Sprite_Ability)). It can be speculated, that mask's symbolism is related to the ability itself to remain unnoticed, but we would like to look into metaphysical aspects of the mask.

Maskeraith in its [frost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Freeze)) and [volcanic](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Volcanic)) reskins acquires properties of [hail](#influences-of-underworld) and [fire deities](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), as unnatural freeze and volcanic motif are two elements, apart from presence of [Vile deity](#fiendish-cults), which persist across much of equipment with those themes.

Lastly, [Snarblepup](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Snarblepup)) is less direct in its conception. But, one property of Snarbolax, which could link the two is the attunement of the latter to [shadows and haunting](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse). The ghostly, non-corporeal nature of the two as seemingly influenced by Underworld, links the two.

Even more so, _so far we have considered entities capable of inflicting curse as ones of most powerful on Cradle_, Maskeraith, under certain conditions, __also possesses an ability to inflict curse__ over [Chaotic Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaotic_Haze#Chaotic_Haze). The very naming convention of `chaotic` and link to all status effects seems to trace back to the [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak).

Maskeriath does not have capacity to deal elemental damage with the crystal harness, but it has piercing, golden harness available. We [have discussed how piercing damage and gold are paired in their divinity](#divinity-and-alchemical-gold), as of metal and an applications of this damage type, and how [crystal and elemental damage are paired though known metaphysics of souls within crystal](#minerals-and-souls-part-2-mineral-charge), now with addition of the relation to the Nameless Realm and its relation to elements.

The dark harness is called simply as that, dark, so not much information could be extracted from it. On the other hand, considering how shadow damage is unnatural to the material realm, its creation could be as vague as the nature of the shadow damage itself, being defined by Spiral Order biotechs only in such vague terms, meaning that the material of the harness is unknown to the point of being created from Underworld materials.

We can make a guess, based on many shadow damage type weapons and equipment, that [shadow steel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Steel) _has a chance of being used here_, mainly due to presence of other metals, such as gold and iron, omitting elemental crystal harness, while allowing for effective combat when equipped.

Considering effects of dark matter, its relation to shadow damage, the very fact, dark matter is used to feed the battle sprite, makes it a very unique in its own regard entity, on par with called here reincarnation of past species - such as Kats and Dragons, - through their according battle sprites.

As we further attempt to identify entities behind Maskeraith, we will attempt to find peculiarities in sprite's evolution similar to an aforementioned [Chaotic Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaotic_Haze#Chaotic_Haze):

- Tier 2 Maskeraith has a single centered horn, which remind of the [Grim Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask).
- The ghastly mask, attained by [Haunted Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Haunted_Haze#Haunted_Haze) ultimate ability has asymmetrical eyes. This asymmetric design is reminiscent of strangers.
- The entity behind Maskeraith design may be one depicted in the designs of the 5 star variants of the [Shade Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shade_Helm) which on its own refers to a concept of shade, as well as having similar head and eye shape, _reminiscent of a beak_, apart from cultural inspirations.

    More so, the larger alchemy tree of [Sentinel Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentinel_Helm) has designs, fitting for those to wield [Cold Iron Vanquisher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher), as alchemy here [transcends modern designs](#technology-alchemy-and-Isoran-redesigns), alluding to Isoran [past during vague position of forgotten time](#gunslinger-priests-part-1).
- The [Shadow Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Cloak_(Battle_Sprite_Ability)) ability is only one depicting sprite's mask, with one eye lit within the part of the mask in the dark, with the other being in the light.

    It makes us think of the anatomical significance of the mask, with the previously established context of mask relating to the soul, which may also point to the nature of Maskeraith as a soul bound to a battle sprite.
- The [Vengeful Quills](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vengeful_Quills#Vengeful_Quills) ultimate ability's design is shown as a _quill similar in color and texture to luminite_. This may be related to the general theme of Owlites and attributed to them and valkyries vengefulness (`A resplendent replica of the shield thought to have been issued to the most eminent of Owlite wizards. Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` - [Grey Owlite Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield)). Paired with potentially avian design, could Maskeraith through unknown means relate to Owlites or greater heavenly kingdom?
- The [Virulent Quills](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Virulent_Quills#Virulent_Quills) ultimate makes the quills seems as made of valestone with more pronounces green hue of the [vile fiend set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mail). The [Caustic Quills](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Caustic_Quills) are seemingly of dark matter. This property ties with close relation of poison to Underworld.
- The [Haunted Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Haunted_Haze#Haunted_Haze) ultimate seemingly _weaponizes souls in the similar manner as Margrel's homing spiked orbs_, as projectiles. Given that defeated enemies release those orbs, makes us think of a common, soul-based, underlying nature of those.
- The [Chaotic Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaotic_Haze#Chaotic_Haze) ultimate, apart from earlier connection to the nature of chaos, is similar to the [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword) status inflictions. And, as the sword is devoid of curse, it may be attributed to it being sealed by paper seals.

    During the _initiation of the haze, ghosts are seen to swirl_, which are likely the effect of the hex  - [Hexing Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hexing_Haze), - being applied.

    This property, we suggest, can be related to the nature of the law, __which had brought spirits to material realm planetary scale in the first place__.

It seems as if power this over souls and undeath was the defining trait of Maskeraith, also being the power which grants those abilities and changes sprite's physicality to one of Underworld. But why this had to happen on a scale on all battle sprite population, remains unknown.

#### Evo Catalysts and The Core

In the context of battle sprite's ultimates, to fully manifest them, [catalysts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ultimate_Evo_Catalyst#Evo_Catalyst) are used.

By the design of those items, it seems they belong to high-tech designs nearing ones of rectangular plates of Core's shell and underlying Whitespace.

While we haven't yet delved into the nature of Whitespace, one element of those designs seems evident - those catalysts open up larger possibilities for evolution, allowing battle sprites to distance themselves from explicitly artificial nature to one embodied by the transformation.

As it was said, battle sprites have erratic energy signatures: `The energy signature I'm detecting is erratic, but still definitely a battle sprite` ([A Revelation in Flames - Sunset Steppes - Rhedon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes)). We propose, that catalysts contain the same transformative effect as the initial transformation through introduction to Cradle, causing deviation from the standard E-class.

And, as those events are happening on Cradle, with presence of the Core and its energy (`Tier 3 is closest to the Core and much like how high level items respond to its power, so do monsters.
Many of them take on new forms and are considered at their most dangerous. You must prepare before taking on each mission` - [Best of the Beast - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Best_of_the_Beast)), we believe, __Catalysts contain the same transformative through application of energy effect, as the the Core__ and its effects onto Cradle by parallels in the design and motif.

As they contain far greater amounts of energy, while being contained within distinct mechanism in design of the _plated structure_, as the Core, the principles, used to contain this energy are __identical to ones applied at the Core__.

With all of those factors considered, we propose, that Maskeraith represents and entity, or several entities, if judged by the masks' shapes, which inhabit the Underworld.

Through this _artificial unity or even overtake of Underworld's curse-aligned powers over a battle sprite_, this creates conditions for a phenomenon, observed so far, as the state of being afflicted by generalized curse with powers granted from this state.

This condition, we believe, is closely related to the nature of [soul being bound to an object](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse), or [haunting](#haunting) -  entering a category of entities, such as, predominantly, Lord Vanaduke's Mask and, in lesser manner, Phantoms, whose powers are derived from being affected by the curse in a non-detrimental manner, while being tethered to a corporeal object.

Due to the aforementioned, _unprecedentedly large,_ set of Maskeraith's skills and abilities, as well as _a potential of manipulating souls over Hexing Haze ultimate_, creation of such entity from an artificial battle sprite seems as another instance of 2 properties merging:

- An unseen power, responsible for manifestation of past civilizations in Seraphynx and Drakon, has applied in the same pattern powers from the Underworld.
- Properties of Underworld's power coexist with aforementioned transfomative power sourced from the Core, suggesting latter's manipulation of the prior, or, intervention of Underworld's influence in the process of battle sprites' creation. Instances of this phenomenon are observed for Snarblepup Maskeraith, Black Kat Seraphynx, and,  [unlikely](), Shadow Drakon. Notably it is only Maskeraith, whose foundational species remain unknown.

So far we have the following conclusions regarding this power:

- This power is emitted from Cradle, influencing classified as [E-class](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Dialogue-E-Class_Battle_Sprite.png) battle sprites. They are transformed, further evolving through Evo Catalysts, containing the same energy used to initially transform them. _Catalysts' designs further link this type of energy with the Core_.
- This energy, when applied, is capable of transforming artificial entities into near-living beings, while preserving their internal structure, so they are identified as Isoran battle sprites by Isoran technology.
- Transformations, induced by this energy, manifest as species with the states of those from the past - Kats of Kat Tribe, both natural and cursed - the latter being Black Kats; dragons of 3 elements; and fiends. _Each sprite embodies the totality of those species_, the families of those species and states they were found in some points in time, and their innate abilities, attributed to those states.
- Those abilities surpass original properties of battle sprites, granting powers, which are naturally intended to be wielded by embodies species as part of their existence. Even if the latter is absent - such as families of Kats or extinct dragons, - those are still remembered within evolutionary branches of the specific battle sprite.

This is a novel concept - of __energy of the Core imprinting species onto battle sprites__.

#### Black Kats and Curse

We will study Black Kats from multiple perspectives: their design, presence on Cradle, - prestige missions, background information on Owlites, and derived knowledge about metaphysics of curse up until this point of the analysis.

Some units of the Kat Tribe seem to be sealed somewhere, most likely Underworld: `Someone or something has summoned a horde of cursed Black Kats into the Clockworks. These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires. In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that Black Kats can't read, so they instead decided to just eat them. The residents of Moorcroft Manor would like you to retrieve the Ancient Pages of the magical grimoires that quite likely reside in the stomachs of Black Kats. We'll leave you to figure out just how to recover them` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)).

Black Kats are explicitly said to be summoned. We concluded on the idea, that it is the same mechanism, which allowed for trojans to be summoned. While their role as ones surviving in undeath past the Kataclysm, someone had to summon them initially at the start o the event.

Grimalkin inhabit places closest to the Underworld, such as Owlite Academy stuck in the same state as Graveyards, between dimensions: `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through`. Grimalkin are similar to Phantoms as they can be stopped only temporality.

- All Black Kats and Margrel possess power to inflict curse.
- Summoning of Margrel introduces a giant maelstrom enveloping entirety of the Moorcroft manor, the same as one seen across malfunctioned grim gates but magnitudes larger.

Through these characteristics a nature of Kataclysm could be narrowed - one of opening a portal into the Underworld, whose influence poured into the material realm, effects the closest of living entities within its reach. Based on earlier quote it seems that Black Kats are different from the rest of Kat Tribe by being bearers of curse. By the time they are summoned, they are already cursed, instead of becoming such through consumption of magical grimoires. This could be a potential precedent for them being explicitly sealed, as trojans, after the Kataclysm. Presence of a [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal), which is also placed on Carnavons, suggests that whatever function the seal serves, _it is applicable to both Carnavons and Black Kats, in the end relating to curse_. Moreover, it is seen on [Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust) itself which should be kept in mind - both the design and color scheme.

This concept of sealing in the Underworld by a faction represented by Valkyries can be also affirmed by a following idea - if trojans were sealed by heavenly kingdom, as the Fallen was banished into the Underworld, the ability to seal Black Kats and to, potentially, summon them back is one likely attributed to those who already used it - Owlites of heavenly kingdom. This would also explain the time when warding candles were invented, as no other darkness, apart from graveyard's, wherein candles were seen, was present at that time - an idea, [linked earlier to the forgotten time of gunslinger priests](#gunslinger-priests-part-2).

Presence of Void Souls inside the Core seems as the strong argument in favour a proposal of the Core, rather that the Kataclysm, being responsible for the local changes in Cradle's metaphysics. In that regard, Core could accelerate the notions already present, in the form of haunted passages, for example, as well as cause seemingly unpredictable behavior, such as transformation of battle sprites, _given general notion of the Core amplifying preexisting traits through energy_. In particular, a transcendence to different types of damage, lacking of normal damage is confirmed by [Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn): `You have a strange definition of recreation if that's the case. Tier 3 fiends and undead are nothing to sneeze at, in fact they're among the worst creatures you'll find so close to the Core. Devilite management seems to be the worst at these depths and that results in some very violent devilites. ... Exactly, and they're worse now. And the same goes for the undead. You'll find that howlitzers become particularly bothersome with their enhanced firing and homing capabilities. Lastly, prepare for fiend and undead monsters to potentially deal pure shadow damage` ([Darkest Forces - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkest_Forces)).

Considering this, we can place period when Philoso made most of his advancement into the very end of Owlite civilization, as then presence of undead would be justified, invention of devices against Underworld's darkness, and most of end-game high-performance equipment, such as Chaos Cloak. Gunslinger priests would be then placed in that same period of time.

##### Margrel and <span class="through-curse">Immortality Through Curse</span>

As for the Kat Tribe potential knowledge on curse, the fact their alchemized armor is one bearing evil eye symbolism - we can look at a different example of an alchemized equipment from an extinct civilization:

- Almirian Crusader armor is completely restored only by traversing Shadow Lairs.
- Ancient Plate armor which we had attributed to titans - tortomega, - has a unique health boost, an `unusual health bonus` both in function and in description of the perk.
- Owlite robes, specifically [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak), despite Owlite being erased from existence, has antique evil eye design on its garb.
- Valkyrian armors connected to resistance to curse.
- `A clawed costume made by Moorcroft tailors. It's perfect for curious knights who are prone to pause for naps after a long night of adventuring` ([Kat Suits](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Kat_Suit)) possesses evil eye designs on the shoulder pads, fitting with the rest of Kat Tribe associated armors.

Based on those instances, it seems that Spiral Order had not performed much modifications to the original designs. We can propose that Kat Tribe had already known of the curse before the Kataclysm. This is also coincidentally fits with Kat Tribe's magic being characterized so far as evil: `A whisker won from the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel. They were traditionally worn as a ward against Owlite magics but now represent the triumph of goodly magical arts over evil` ([Wicked Whisker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Whisker)). As the name suggests, wicked, it possesses properties, more likely to be attributed to the entire theme of curse and Underworld.

##### Dark Ritual, Pink Lightning: Part 1 - Fiends

The last element if the pink lightning striking Margrel's ritual site when it is summoned. We suggest, so far, a vague idea of it being a sign of Underworld's presence, as across myth's lightning strike was associated with the presence of the supernatural, or more commonly, divine presence or intervention.

In case of the dark ritual, it is not the divine presence, but of Underworld. We have to consider similar lightning in case of Arkus, formation of minerals, we can suggest that it was the tapping into the Underworld's more distinct energy, one of the same nature as the one to cause minerals to form.

The real reasoning for specifically Arkus's behavior here is vague, but we can lean into the idea of trojans inflicting shock, as they possess inner charge, which can be weaponized. And, as in both instances there are lightning arcs stemming from the dark matter crystal as a sign of Underworld's influence, we believe it to be linked to this condition.

This does not constitute that the crystal was embedded, as we have already covered the case of dark matter. But rather it serves as the conduit for the connection with the Underworld.

As for Sparks of Life - as those are already discrete quantities of energy, enough to revive, presence of lightning could seem as a design choice. And yet, it is accompanied by falling dust, similar to the presence of the Swarm. This seems as a different instance of signaling energy's presence through blue lightning, its excess, symbolized by the temporary attack buff.

When Margrel is summoned, bright soul orbs are seem to be attracted to the ritual site with a distinct red-pink swirl forming, characteristic of the collapsed grim gate's portal. Then the portal overtakes the entirety of the depth, and soul-like projectiles are now spiked orbs.

As Black Kats are said to be explicitly summoned, and during Margrel's fight they appear in large amounts, this seems to us, as if the portal in the grim gates and gateway for Black Kats to cross into material realm are physically identical.

#### Dread Seal: Part 1

Presence of Dread Seals both on Black Kats, Margrel, and Carnavons also seems as if it was placed by somebody, - an idea we mentioned several times. There, based on the design and naming convention of a seal, __we have assumed that the Seal is devised by Valkyries or Owlites__, as it is means to contain or seal the curse. If wwe looked onto the design itself, __Seal's design is similar to the Fu talisman, as it is placed by priest on ghost's forehead in order to hinder or disarm it.__

This concept is also reminiscent of the [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword), which we proposed to be the retrieved and sealed variant of Gran Faust, as it possesses in all of alchemy paths evil eye symbolism, suggesting that the symbol was recontextualized in the Avenger line of upgrades.

The state of this sword, as a sealed one, we considered the reason for its lack of ability to inflict curse, compared to, for example, [Chaotic Haze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaotic_Haze#Chaotic_Haze) of Maskeraith, as it is not restricted by the seals, but latter's nature and powers are drawn from the Underworld.

Based on this we have to assume, that the party which had placed the Dread Seals onto Carnavons and Black Kats are Owlites and, potentially, Valkyries of heavenly kingdom. Specifically, _given presence of priests in both contexts, gunslinger priests seems to be the one faction most plausibly responsable for placement of the seals onto the undead._

On the contrary, there is only speculated existence of a war between the undead Almirian Empire and heavenly kingdom. Paired with the presence of a seal on Carnavons, this would be a fitting explanation. But so far we lack any further evidence.

From this, 3 further interpretations of the timeline emerge:

- Dread Seals belongs to Owlites. Carnavons had to appear later into the timeline, but still in the past  - before emergence of Kat Tribe, - as they would be once to encounter Owlites in order for Dread Seals to be placed.
- Dread Seals belongs to Owlites. Margrel and the rest of Black Kats at some point in time had to be marked with the seal, either after the Kataclysm or in the Underworld, from where they are summoned. Given lack of devilite presence in that regard, we can only assume that the annual summoning of Black Kats was a later development after the fall of Owlites. This proposal assumes a war between heavenly kingdom and undead Almirian Empire, given presence of undead in the academy.
- The Dread Seal specifically, not its golden variant present on the Avenger, is Underworld's invention. We propose such scenario due to purple color, uncharacteristic of Owlite technology and magic, presence of curse-colored seal on Faust, which is more likely to belong to the Underworld, and fue to trojans lacking the seal, but they are once known to be explicitly sealed by heavenly kingdom. There is a possibility of Dread Seal being a later invention, but _this would contradict with a more common presence of Black Kats, as they are seemingly more easy to be summoned, compared to trojans._ It is due to seals design and assumed function, we came to an idea of Black Kats being sealed.

Prior 2 instances create a requirement for a period of time, when Owlites had to persist for some time after the initial Kataclysm. Even if Carnavons would be marked with the seal before the Kataclysm, Kat Tribe remains.

_Given presence of evil eye symbolism on the Chaos Cloak,_ as well as its resistances, we assume, that it would be the reason for a major advancement in understanding of curse and general cosmology by Owlites.

We could've attributed Dread Seal to Underworld, which would seem more fitting, as the seal is purple, rather than yellow or gold, as in the Avenger, but given Chaos Cloak, we encounter a case of a, seemingly, cultural shift at least in the designs. Due to this less distinctive property, we have to come back to the intention of the Dread Seal after we cover the [Shadow Firestorm Citadel]().

#### Owlite's Inversion of Curse

It is here a concept of inverted curse should be brought up. Golden evil eye present on the [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger) is of heavenly kingdom, or more specifically, of later research, once curse was discovered, likely from Valkyries' invasion of Underworld and sealing of Legion of Ur.

Compared to the Dread Seal of purple color, golden variation of the seal with higher probability belongs to heavenly kingdom due to thematic and design change and association through color. If we consider the idea of Faust and Dread Seal being of Underworld, it would thematically be fitting for golden seal be at least an inversion of the prior state, being placed within a completely weaponized against Underworld sword, derived of Gran Faust. _This thematic approach would constitute, that the seal would be inverted, too, from Underworld's Dread Seal to a supposed golden seal of heavenly kingdom_.

The [Divine Veil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Veil) has [Silverweave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave) woven in it, which is described as: `A length of understated cloth intricately interwoven with precious metal. its tastefully ostentatious, yet prudently protective` ([Silverweave](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave)). Considering its usage in alchemy, we can guess that the precious metal in question is [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver).

Sun Silver and [Miracloth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracloth) are used in [Divine Avenger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger). Miracloth is relevant to the [Miracle armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Cloak), prediminantly due to incorporration of a theme of miracles:

- `A marvelous bolt of sublimely supple fabric` ([Miracloth](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracloth)).
- `A miraculous mask said to grant a single miracle to the wearer when they need it most. In practice, it'll likely save your skin more often than that` ([Miracle Hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Hood)).
- `A miraculous mantle said to grant a single miracle to the wearer when they need it most` ([Miracle Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Cloak)).

All of the alchemy branch has an elemental motif: _magic, elemental, miracle, and chaos, accompanied by the divine_. Those characteristics, we suggest, __relate to the nature of Nameless Realm, as one containing within itself all element with no exception__, where miracles point at the supernatural properties interpreted as divine rather than strictly occult, as seen by other instances of chaotic motif.

We have to keep this concept in mind, but currently, it reminds us most of the one other concept - an alchemical Prime Matter, originated from the round chaos of the void, from which world proper was created. [We will analyze this motif in greater detail as we approach themes of Mercury in the analysis of gremlin technology]().

While the Void will be discussed later, of course, it is the very one mentioned in the very beginning in relation to the Swarm, Nameless Realm is what is in the focus of this discussion. We have to keep nature of Nameless Realm as a potential alchemical candidate for the originating place of all matter, but we still do not know anything in regards to the in-universe Void. So this is the concept we must keep in mind.

#### Owlite Witches, Magicians, and Wizards

The relation of Owlites to curse is present in different instance. Earlier, when we have discussed Isoran redesigns, we briefly noted the concept of vials found across Clockworks to be invention of Spiral Order: `The wizarding guilds, with the help of the Owlite faction, have long been responsible for helping to manufacture some of the more volatile potions used by knights daily. Spiral HQ has conjured spellbinding items to help resupply these extraordinary knights. The Wizard Prize box celebrates these guilds' mysterious arcane power` ([Wizarding Ways](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/124845)). Those vials while do include curse, also contain the rest of status effects, which suggests a degree and depth of knowledge required to create those vials in the first place, which is stated to be derived of Owlites. It is also established, that a concept of magic at that point in time is incorporated into Spiral Order's hierarchy.

As exploration of Cradle and its civilizations has corresponded to knight's progression through the ranks, we can point at a few distinct instances, which may soidify exact series of discoveries which had allowed Spiral Order to further progress in research of magic.

We suggest, that the research was conducted from exploration of Owlite ruins by Spiral Order, as we pointed out to be, among present cases, near the time exploration of the [Eternal Study was conducted by Edger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Edger), as he says: `I could leave but think of all I could learn if I stayed!; It's good to know Spiral HQ hasn't forgotten about me; Thanks for "rescuing" me but I feel fine`.

This idea of a knight being considered missing: `A knight named Edger has gone missing while exploring the Scarlet Fortress. Given that this crumbling castle is swarming with spookats and jelly cubes, his squadmates fear for his safety and have asked a more experienced knight like yourself to investigate. Locate Edger within the fortress and bring him back to Haven!` ([Time Enough at Last](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Time_Enough_at_Last)) who, in reality, was present all of this time in the study, with presence of wizard-themed gear, now carries greater implication of how Spiral Order may change with introduction of those concepts.

In relation, now directly, to Owlites - if the vials are the result of Spiral Order's research, - we would ask weather curse was for Owlites as much utilitarian, becoming a tool in combat, as it is for Spiral Order. The existence of [cauldrons]() also implies, that the contents of those potions, or vials, are made exactly there, that the liquid is the bearer of curse, as well as other status effects.

We do know, that Chaos Clock incorporates properties of curse with other elements, suggesting its native nature to Nameless Realm. In the context of this utilitarian framing, the curse becomes a natural element of reality, albeit unconventional one, and given dula nature of Owlite tomes, we lean to the ide of Owlites being aware of the dangers this magic inherently provides.

#### Arcane Salamanders

Taking in consideration salamander species, as one we have suggested to be the species of which Howlitzers were raised, we have to look at arcane salamander suit and arcane halo:

- `A Salamander Suit imbued with magical power. It is thought to be made from the familiars of powerful witches` ([Arcane Salamander Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcane_Salamander_Suit)).
- [Arcane Halo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcane_Halo#Arcane_Halo) has a similar color and name, suggesting it to be related to the suit.

The magical power being refered as here as the reason for the suit to possess its design contributes to the meaning behind the term arcane. As familiars are most likely salamanders, as suggested by armor's design, we can suggest that witches were familiar both with the species and were skilled enough to be aware of magic, proviced by the alchemy and evident by armor's defenses.

As Arcane Halo is retrieved from the [Nemesis Prze Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nemesis_Prize_Box) which _already has angelic motifs_, we propose, that witches belong to people of heavenly kingdom.

Furthermore, the term of arcane, we propose is meant to be associated with wizardry of speciifcally Owlite origin: `The Wizard Prize box celebrates these guilds' mysterious arcane power` ([Wizarding Ways](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/124845)), which seems fitting given strict design elements and themes of those items.

As for transmutation of Arcane Salamander equipment [Maiden's Tear](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maiden%27s_Tear): `A sacred jewel cherished by Almirian knights. Given to them by their beloved, it is said to keep them safe in battle` is required, we can suggest, that it is a unique property of the jewel which allows for the creation of that equipment.

While we do not suggest that Owlites did take those jewels from fallen Almire, we will keep this potential concept in mind predominantly due to vague origin of embers for candles of Candlestick Keep.

##### Embers of Candles

Our prime reasoning for that consists of the idea of Blue Candles being separate from yellow candle due to longevity of the blue flame, while the embers are also seemingly timeless.

The longevity of embers long past existence of Owlites had led us to suggest that embers possess an unnatural nature, maybe even, _embers being of shadow fire of Almire_ -- at the Grasping Plateau of Shroud of Apocrea, a __burning sarcophagus__ can be found, reminiscent of [opened burning grave of Torin]() found across the graveyards of Clockworks. _As embers are located near the grave_, this had led us to an idea of Owlites deeply reseraching Almire to the point of repurposing shadow flames due to their unnatural longevity for their own use for candles.

We will return to those themes of Owlites researching Almire onse we will [discuss]() the Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

#### Moorcroft and Retchwell Manors

Remaining spookats, the undead Kat Tribe, has established the Moorcroft Manor within one of Owlite castles, where they move rest of recovered artifacts, including the [Book of Grey Feathers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand) defiled by Margrel as well as other tomes: [Tome of Rage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_Rage) and [Mythical Tome](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand): `A podium displaying a magical tome filled with arcane symbols, esoteric formulae, and (a) few particularly rude doodles`.

_This makes it seem, as if the Manor is one of the remaining distinctly conscious faction of Kat species after the Kataclysm._ Even more so, the existence of the [Restless Railroad](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad) suggests, that there are potentially other locations, which withstood in undeath the events of Kataclysm, unrelated to the Undercorp specifically.

Apart from Moorcroft Manor there exist other manors, populated by more hostile spookats - such is the [Retchwell Manor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scared_to_Death#Gate_Map) and its [Iron Courtyards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scared_to_Death#Gate_Map). Given the design choice of the mission to contain rotating elemental variants of the manor, we can suspect the manor itself being much larger compared to the Moorcroft Manor even with the Restless Railroad included.

As far as Kataclysm allows to look into Owlites' past, we do not have information, weather culture of manors was present in the past, it was a post-Kataclysmic culture shift among undead Kat Tribe. The Retchwell Manor is implicitly referred as an `Owlite castle[s]` in its mission: `The ruins of Owlite castles are dark and cursed places that are swarming with legions of undead spookats. The worst of these, the seemingly invincible grimalkins, constantly lurk in the shadows, awaiting the moment your life-saving light is finally snugged out. Some knights succumb to the darkness and become paralyzed with fear in these shadowy realms. The only thing that can save them are brave knights who have long lost their childhood fears of the dark and all the terrible creatures that lurk within ... Save the lost Knight from joining the ranks of the dead in the haunted manor` ([Scared to Death](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scared_to_Death)). But as it is stated to be haunted, could there be a time, when it was a regular castle-like manor?

While Tome stands were covered, Tome of Rage is of particular interest to us due to a symbol of alchemy in its cover. Is symbol of alchemy also universal? As alchemy is used by Spiral Order for many years, and as energy seems to be universal, the symbol of alchemy is present across many locations, mainly in the form of alchemy station, including one in the Sanctuary - most remote location of all known to date, apart from the Apocrean Realm bleeding onto material realm, but also, alchemy orbs. Considering nature of the latter as catalysts for the transmutation itself, it is the philosopher's stone - the results of the Great Work, allowing for any matter to be transmuted into different matter. So far, __Alchemy Orbs seem to be universal, emerging mechanism from utilizing alchemy, same as the symbol of a spiral or energy__.

The Moorcroft Manor became the main hub for less hostile of spookats. There, a ritual site was established and taken hold of by [Konjuring Kat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat) for banished grimalkin to be summoned, utilizing same fiendish sigils made from Moonstone, with several attempts by far resulting in [Kataclysmic Confrontation](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation), but with the presence of the tomes from Owlite libraries, - as much of ancient texts and levels connects back to Owlite academy, a different approach could be taken: of summoning banished to the Underworld Kat Tribe kats through powers of Nameless Realm, studied by Owlites. To be precise, _a law, utilized by Grim Gates to bridge Underworld and material realm, is applied to summon Black Kats._

Ritual site, when activated, has similar effects of trailing light orbs as the [Mystical Tome Stand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Furniture#Animations). Although Margrel summoning site is not made of dark matter, sigils themselves and same curse-colored maelstrom before Margrel is summoned, bearing similarity to closing portals of Grim Gates.

##### Nefarious Imp and Margrel, and Kataclysm

The entire plot of Margrel, as well as of Nefarious Imp relation to it must still be kept in mind. Margrel is summoned by accident, but he himself is capable of summoning Black Kats as the unknown party. The Konjuring kat does not seem as the nefarious entity referred by the [Book of Dark Rituals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals): `Just like any cursed tome, there is likely some twisted individual out there who wants it for extremely nefarious purposes`, which adds a point to devilites, Undercorp even, being those actors, if not the Imp himself behind the Black Kat plot. Someone had to place this dread seal in the same manner as elemental Lumbers possess it.

If we would develop ths idea further, we would suggest, that Nefarious Imp is behind the formation of Kat Tribe  in the first place, as the latter supposedly has incorporated antique evil eye designs into its armors. While the antique design comes from either titans or graviton bomb, under current theory it had to be derived from the general simplified symbol of the evil eye tracing back to Greavers.

Then, the idea of sleeper cell within Owlite civilization would imply a planning rooted in a conflict of interests targeted at Owlites and greater heavenly kingdom.

Despite the distinct lack of presence of Undercorp, brought up here as a perpetrator for the summoning of Black Kats, it seems to us to be a part of a narrative, where Cradle, or material realm in general, is sieged throughout the years by Underworld. This proposal, compared to supposedly postmodern interpretation of many unconnected one-off stories being discovered over Cradle, connected from the start under a theme of Underworld's involvement.

#### Seraphynx and Divine Kats

As Drakon became reincarnation of dragons, so Seraphynxs became reincarnations of Black Kats of Kat Tribe before their banishment. This process has resulted in resemblance of Kat Tribe with heavenly powers of valkyries. And yet, identities of Kat Tribe resurface as these sprites are yet again drawn to Owlite tomes: `I think these sprites are studying these old books. I didn't even know they could read!` ([Angels from Antiquity/Restless Railroad - Rhendon](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad)), specifically in a location looking particularly the same as the one in the Moorcroft Manor inhabited by the [Konjuring Kat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat).

- [Katastrophe Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Returns_Prize_Box) has both banished Kat Tribe accessories and Valkyries', except for regular themed items.
- [Seraphynx (Black Kat)](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Black_Kat)) has all the signs of banished Kat Tribe, plus characteristics of Owlite anatomy, specifically [Prismatic Seraph'tenna](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Seraph%27tenna), and equipment of valkyrie armor: [Prismatic Dazzling Gem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Dazzling_Gem), [Prismatic Heavenly Halo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Heavenly_Halo), and prismatic wings ([Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings)).

Through [Seraphynx](#seraphynx) it is more or less known how kats have looked originally, moreover having divine attributes to them, which fits with prior idea of sleeper cell of Kat tribe in, seemingly, academy and greater heavenly kingdom, embodying this period of time. As far as that time period allows, the origins of civilization of Kats remain unknown.

This design contradicts the idea of Kat Tribe possessing curse-themed armor, unless, we pose them as outliers. This idea is based on the fact of sleeper cell existing within Owlite civilization, as kats, serving kat Tribe: `An impressive mail instilled with the might of Kat Nappers, the undercover sleeper cell of the Kat Tribe` ([Black Kat Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Mail)).

In this interpretation, Kats seem to possess divine attributes, with the Kat Tribe, led by Margrel, to be outliers. It is then the unknown reason for Margrel's plot to capture the Book of Grey Feathers. If we would attempt to draw parallels with other curse-ridden entities, - Lord Vanaduke, trojans, Fallen Valkyrian, titans even, - they all have fallen to Underworld's influence due to compromised means. In case of the Book of Grey Feather, the only 2 items which would imply its contents are the [Divine Mantle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle) and [Chaos Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak), as both relate to __fundamental, curse incorporated, chaotic properties of reality__.

#### Divinity Motifs

Lastly, due to connection of seemingly nature-themed magic and Nameless Realm, here we suggest a potential inspiration behind Nature Sprites.

We have previously discussed their anatomy as closely related to nature, both being fur-coated nature-themed civilization and their nature-themed spiral designs of magic [seen in the Firestorm Citadel](#almire-and-spirit-mother).

##### Motif 1: Nature

The idea of those creatures in the context of heavenly, or rather Celestial Kingdom, reminds us of the moon rabbits, or Jade Rabbits. They are relevant in the Chinese myth of Hou Yi and Moon Goddess Chang'e.

According to the myths, originally, 9 Suns were present in the sky, rising one after another, but one day they appeared all together, scorching the earth, causing a cataclysm. An archer, Hou Yi, shot down 8 of 9 Suns, allowing only for a single Sun to rise, and as a reward, gods granted Hou Yi elixir of immortality, which he shared with his wife, Chang'e.

Recounts of the myth here do differ, as Chang'e is said to potentially steal the elixir. Chang'e was not supposed to drink elixir of immortality, and due to this she was banished to the moon. In other retelling of the myth, Chang'e had to depart to the Moon, as immortals could not exist on Earth.

Moon Rabbits are related to Chang'e, being associated with Chang'e, as well as take part in the creation of the elixir of immortality on the Moon. Across myths their are depicted as benevolent or mischievous creatures.

This legend is an example of immortality's presence across many different cultures, starting from western alchemy and eastern beliefs, around which the later concept of alchemy was also built up. Due to depiction of the spiral on the Moon's near side, general _association of the Spiral with a deific influence_, there can be a symbolic meaning for it.

But, as Chang'e seemingly differs in her intentions compared to Spirit Mother, this may be only a similarity, rather than a direct inspiration. Although presence of the moon might be relevant in this context, as it can serve as a candidate for the heavenly kingdom, potentially less related to the castles of Clockworks, or even preceding them, as there is an established divinity of celestial beings. It is on the Moon, according to the myth, Hou Yi constructs a palace for his wife.

Despite this seemingly unrelated approach, there is an important element to it, __of spiral being a symbol for natural order__.

##### Motif 2: Banishment

Due to how celestial beings - as valkyries, - are positioned in the opposition to Underworld through the [Fallen Valkyrian](#fallen-valkyrian), and other equipment, his fall already involves crossing at least into Underworld - that being 2 realms. So, a _cross-dimensional aspect is present, according to the general cosmology, rather than being confined to material realm, there are 3 realms to include_.

And, if we take other religious motifs, this heavenly kingdom, albeit through metaphors, could have been located in a different realm, rather than directly above 3 mountains above Almire, as [discussed earlier](#celestial-kingdom), which on its own can be considered at a certain interpretation, a different realm or in proximity of it - suggested by Spirit Mother's realm. It would be then still plausible for this heavenly kingdom not to intervene with the Almire's Fall, while they would be located in, supposedly, between material realm and supposed paradise of Spirit Mother's realm, _evident by the unique properties of its water_.

But, this proposal conflicts with the idea of Nameless Realm being forbidden, so there must be a reason for it. We can suggest, that modern Owlites discovered the Nameless Realm proper, from which the knowledge of sealing magic would be discovered, and, it follows curse symbolism.

Apart from our so far vague motif of cursed immortality, the idea of a secret to immortality residing on the Moon, seems here, if extrapolated onto Spiral Knights multi-dimensional alchemical and occult cosmology, seems as if the Nameless Realm, as prime matter, would be the soul-powered source of immortality, granted by entities residing there.

##### Motif 3: Heaven

Here, we suggest, given now both interpretations of Spirit Mother, the similarity to the [Celestial Kingdom]() and Queen Mother of the West seems more fitting, paired with the heavenly kingdom being located atop of 3 mountains, closely associated with [dragons](), [primordial powers]() and [creation myth]().

How reality of Cradle was falling into Apocrean Realm within the [Shroud of Apocrea](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea_(Mission)) or _how Owlite Academy and graveyards are sinking into Underworld_. This also fittingly ties with the naming convention both of _Valkyries, as divine guardians, and as celestials_, who did come as [auras and souls](#auras-and-souls) from the higher realm to [corporeal bodies](#corporeal-body), closely connected to the source of souls - our to be proposed Nameless Realm.

But, as far as current understanding of the cosmology allows, we are presented with 2 higher realms, one of which is deeply related to heavenly kingdom. This realm, as suggested by the earlier established role of valkyries, is to be protected by them.

And as in the modern times there are no other realm which requires protection, while being the most alien, there are no other candidates than the Whitespace of the Core, which houses Sleeper, whose need in protection was the driving mechanism for Clockworks to be constructed: `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME. VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory]()).

How we transition from the prior, more classic interpretation of paradise to highly advances, seemingly artificial nature of Whitespace? How all of this symbols, themes and narratives collide in the modern period of time as Isorans crash land on Cradle?

This is a proposal we will discuss once we cover entirety of Clockworks. But, one element of this framework we will reveal now, which as much as it is fitting, at this stage might be considered a coincidence.

As Clockworks were build for vulnerable _slumbering Sleeper_, as Cradle is called so, would Clockworks themselves, then, by their name alone, be associated with a clock, by which Sleeper's slumber was meant to end. The Cradle is what it is - it is named and built to house a sleeping deity. What would happen then, once Sleeper wakes up?

##### Motif 4: Duality

If we attempt to develop this evidently vague thematically driven idea further, we would eventually arrive to a mirrored position to curse. As curse - alien for material realm, while granting immortality by tethering soul to material realm, or serving as a method of suspending indefenetely physical body with soul tethered to it; would the state of divinity, coming from the paradise, cause the same effect of immortality, but in opposite to Underworld's influence, of one's soul being closer to an "absolute" realm of energy, from where those souls come from?

As far as we were looking at the heavenly kingdom of Valkyries, they seem to present this exact case - a civilization of celestial guardians of paradise, as the location from which Fallen Valkyrian was cast down.

We have seen in instances of Sacred Circle and Owlite Tomes, that they operate by the same principle as circles of art - of "fiendish" sigils made of minerals inscribed into patterns or assembled into configurations, through which they radiate auras or store energy, store data, used as the basis both for Owlite magic and spells, Underworld's operation, connection of realms both to lower ones and to higher ones. So, there is a common principle for those seemingly distant civilizations.

Under this paradigm of duality, what if material realm was not invaded, but blessed by a realm above. As Lord Vanaduke had died in the ash pits below Blackened Shrine, then being reborn as a fiend, what would such process be called for a divine realm descending to material realm?

But, as so far there is a consistent narrative of curse and Undercorp's involvement, what would happen, considering this position of material realm on the metaphysical stack, if lower realm, such as Underworld, would have attempted to siege heavenly kingdom and a realm it inhabits though power of curse?

Apart from symbolism of curse, there is one more connection worth mentioning - one of Apocrea as a dreaming entity similar to Sleeper - asso far Sleeper is associated with a motif of divinity, the name Apocrea can be interpreted as one derived of _Apocrypha_ - a name of texts, which were expluded outside of Jewish and Protestant canons of the Old Testament.

This, if applied to Apocrean Relam, we suggest, marks it as outside of the space which is considered part of natural reality, beginning from the most divine realm. How this translates to the thems both realms possess, we are yet to discover, but, as far as our initial anlysis of Apocrea's motivations suggests, this distinction is driven by Apocrea's intent to `return this cosmic play to its primordial black` ([Professor Allister Danford](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

For now, we are required to finally analyze metaphysics of curse, as it is the most essential element, as through its wide presence aforementioned divine motifs were identified.

### _Intermission &#160;<br>_ Metaphysics Of Curse

Before we move on to the analysis of Gremlin Empire, specifically nature of the complex network of connections between the Core, Whitespace, and the Swarm, with an addition of Sleeper, Architect, and the Void, we are required to cover everything we now know of the phenomenon of Curse up until this point with the fullest context of corresponding periods of time.

For this, we are now required to analyze Shadow Lairs, as it the region, which contains so far glanced over Shadow Firestorm Citadel and the miasma of Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods, mentioned briefly in the [analysis of Snarbolax's curse](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse). But, due to sheer size of the topic, its many nuances, _we will decouple the context of Shadow Lairs from the content_. Specifically, we are not concerned with nature or origin of Shadow Lairs and Swarm, but with phenomena which take place in those lairs - miasma and the curse. We will also discuss the causality of those events, with Shadow Firestorm Citadel being our main point of concern in regards to what is considered canon.

After we are done with the properties of the Citadel and Wildwoods, their plausible positions in the timeline, separated from the nature of Shadow Lairs themselves, we will perform the final summary of the metaphysics of curse.

Shadow Lairs are introduced in a manner (`Shadows Fall Over Cradle!` - [Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), which suggest, that the boss entities are alive while Spiral Order possess extended knowledge on them, as if they were already encountered:

- `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`
- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and its king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!`
- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory has begun creating in fiery weapons and improved upon its ultimate weapon in the form of the Red Roarmulus Twins!`
- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Lord Vanaduke!`

#### Miasma

The miasma is described as the reason for the change within the Wildwoods: `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`

We can consolidate effects of the miasma to the following properties:

- Enemies affected by the miasma inflict poison.
- Due to miasma, undeath is far more widespread and severe across the Wildwoods.
- Snarbolax, in its shadowy form, gains poisonous properties, in its form resembling Graveyards' tombstones with green glowing veins.
- The Wildwoods are covered with red mist.

When Snarbolax is encountered, apart from being rabid, it is present in multiple instances. We have previously suggested, that [Snarbolax is cursed](#snarbolax-and-haunting-through-curse), with curse accumulating in its hide, granting immortality in a less detrimental manner. Snarbolax was defeated by knights, unless it is not one of its kind, as later suggested by presence of multiple it instances in the Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods and affirmed by [Snarblepup Maskeraith]().

There is also a case of [Vile Engine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine) mission and its [slime generators](), which were the reason for Rotting Metropolis' existence: `It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them. A modern city, much like those that the devilites inhabit seems to be overrun with these toxins, and was probably left behind by both the devilites and gremlins as a result. Now a legion of slime and undead creatures haunt the place, festering in the poisons that linger in the air. A squad that was attempting to pass through the city has gone missing. Given that the very air is toxic ...` ([The Rotting Metropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Rotting_Metropolis)). And in order for miasma to appear, slime generators could be a plausible precedent for existence of poisoned Gloaming Wildwoods and Rabid Snarbolax. Considering that all of Clockwork location can be moved, the prime example being molten cavern of Firestorm Citadel - `The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. ... We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can. You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)), it is plausible for the Wildwoods at some point being affected by the [slime generators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) at depth 22.

But, on the other hand, the __miasma is most reminiscent of curse due to its red color__, _the color itself makes it distinct from toxic and quicksilver lichens of Vile Engine_. And at that, thematically, it seems to us that gremlins are not ones to be involved in the creation of, at least, Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods. This red mist is similar to one present on fiend-inhabited Clockwork Tunnels, with a characteristic pink hue, the [Infernal Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Infernal_Passage).

As it was discussed earlier, we had proposed an existence of a [Vile Deity](#fiendish-cults), who is the reason behind supernatural occurrences related to poison and undeath across graveyards, as well as being here the embodiment of supernatural properties of poison. In case of miasma, the description and setting is fitting, but not the color of mist itself, unless this supernatural nature also exists, one traced back to Underworld.

It is then a question weather Vile Deity actually exists and what is its influence onto material realm. As far as we would not lean to this idea, we can not deny __a theme of poison carrying a supernatural element in its extremes__, starting from [Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence): `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease.` as it is a material from the same tier and design as [Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost) and [Flame Souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul). It is due to all of covered so far motifs we suggest, that a type of supernatural plague is present here - _an idea of miasma coming from Underworld._

The red mist is the main point of concern and a counter argument for Slime Generators being responsible for the creation of the miasma. So far, a few potential leads can be connected to this phenomenon:

- Red mist is similar to the glow of Maskeraith's [Vengeful Shadow Cloak](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vengeful_Shadow_Cloak#Vengeful_Shadow_Cloak). Although the design differs, as Maskeraith cloak has yellow lightning bolts within it, the mist does not. The density of Maskeraith cloak does not allow to see through it, most reminiscent of strong reddish glow and wind below the [Core Terminal](#core-terminal).
- The context of the word _miasma across mythology is usually considered as a divine punishment and illness_. The illness is present in the woods, but the punishment aspect remains unknown.
- The stone lantern found across the woods are similar to the Yukimi-Gata lanterns and 5-layer stone stupas.

Among those proposals, we lean to the idea of the miasma being the result of [collapsing grim gates' portal](#grim-gates-portal-collapse), [described earlier](#grim-gates) in regards to Undercorp sabotaging tortomega efforts. We have proposed, that the reason for this large-scale spread of curse-related affliction is due to [Undercorp turning against Titans](#the-fall-of-titans), erasing their civilization through mechanical change of tortodrones. But, if we consider such scenario, how an event from the past would've made an appearance in the present? This concept, we believe, ties with the greater nature of Shadow Lairs, yet, we have to establish an ongoing motif.

As far as solely Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods allow us to hypothesize, __Miasma came from the Grim Gates back when titans were annihilated by corrupted tortodrones__. On Cradle, miasma reemerges as either the result of still unseen actor - embodied by the Nefarious Imp, or, due to events of [March of Tortodrones](), where the portals were collapsed through intervention of Knights. Given that those event have happened at later point in time, as a singular event similar to other Shadow Lairs, we are leaning to the idea of Undercorp being involved here, while acknowledging still unknown properties of Shadow Lairs, and, separately, a plausibility of a cause in the form of Grim Gates.

##### Vials

Among vials, which were created by wizards of Spiral Order, we can find following descriptions of their contents:

- `A glass vial containing a molten mixture. It can be used to inflict enemies with Fire. Throw it like a grenade and turn 'em into toast!` (Fire Vial).
- `A glass vial containing hyper-charged electric fluids. It can be used to inflict enemies with Shock. Throw it like a grenade and give your foes a real ZAP!` (Shock Vial).
- `A glass vial containing glacial wind. It can be used to inflict enemies with Freeze. Throw it like a grenade and chill your foes right in place!` (Freeze Vial).
- `A glass vial containing debilitating toxins. It can be used to inflict enemies with Poison. Throw it like a grenade and wither the attack power of your foes!` (Poison Vial).

4 basic or classic elements, closely associated with elemental damage, apart from frost, which caries shadow damage properties, are described distinctly: molten mixture, electric fluids, glacial wind, toxins. Those terms are easy to conceptualize, with glacial windds being more magical compared to the rest, but still tangible physical concept confined to the volums of the vial.

Then, there are stun and sleep, which do not particularly change in their concept:

- `An ornate glass vial containing shimmering flash pellets. It can be used to inflict enemies with Stun. Throw it like a grenade and your foes will be too stupefied to give chase!` (Stun Vial).
- `A glass vial containing a drowsy draught. It can be used to inflict enemies with Sleep. Throw it like a grenade and your foes will be snoring in seconds!` (Sleep Vial).

And then, there is Curse Vial: `A glass vial containing concentrated fiend essence. It can be used to inflict enemies with Curse. Throw it like a grenade and give your foes 10 years of bad luck!`.

This frames curse as an essence - a __distinct mass of undefined properties, much reminiscent of essence-type materials_ in the inventory. Curse is also characterized here to be of fiendish origin, which makes its source to be Underworld, reaffirming its alien nature to material realm.

#### True Citadel of Almirian Empire

Shadow Firestorm Citadel is in much regard by margin far more dangerous than its regular counterpart and any other location across Clockworks. The presence of Nature Sprites and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, the lack of the console create unique conditions in order for it to exist within the canon.

Shadow Firestorm Citadel is similar to the unknown chronology of frozen over Shadow Royal Jelly Palace within the timeline, including the fact of both had to [contain a console](#gremlin-containments-and-consoles).

To analyze nature of this variant of the Citadel, we have to start by isolating history and design of the concept of Firestorm Citadel.

It is known that it was the Grand Citadel of Almire: `From atop the highest tower of the Grand Citadel of Almire, Vanaduke watched his kingdom crumble. ... Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall)), and `You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great Kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice` ([King of Ashes - Blackstone Bridge - Lost Soul](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Blackstone_Bridge))).

Kingdom of Almire was located near the volcanic mountains, ones which held an altar to a fiery deity, [which we concluded to be Vog](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), an Underworld deity. Almire's nature-themed designs, as well as a strong connection to Spirit Mother, which was the reason for her intervention, had resulted in capture of several Nature Sprites in the Citadel itself by the time Lord Vanaduke had returned transformed.

At some point, the Citadel and an unknown part of the landmass comprising the kingdom of Almire were captured by the Core, with its cities seemingly intact, as suggested by the [Necropolis Grounds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Necropolis_Grounds). Starting from it, Firestorm Citadel was permeating through the Clockworks. But, when the Knights have arrived, it anomalously resurfaced in proximity, or even above to the Core:

- `We thought things were getting pretty predictable, even at the depths you've been exploring. The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. We don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing. This is bad news` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).
- `That mass of negative energy we've been investigating is a portion of an ancient kingdom called Almire, the very same realm described in that Owlite tome you discovered!` ([Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle)).

Paired with the fact it is instrumental to opening the Core [in the events of Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay), this seems to us as a reason for its movement, orchestrated by an unknown party.

Large number of followed up missions were concerned with getting in proximity of the Citadel:

- `We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can. You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).
- `An unlikely source of intel has surfaced from the residents of Moorcroft Manor. A few of the spookats that call it home contacted one of our visiting Recon Knights and provided details of the negative energy mass that has appeared above the Core. Calling it 'a place of burning hatred' and 'a prison for dark souls' they say that you can read all about it in 'one of those weird Owlite books' in an Owlite keep they pinpointed. If what they claim is true Spiral HQ could gain valuable intel from investigating the Owlite keep. Just remember that these Owlite structures have all proven to be swarming with the lost souls of countless undead monsters` ([An Occurrence at Owlite Keep](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep)).

  It directly connects Scarlet Fortress, [The Hall of Remembrance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep), to the [The Forgotten Library](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Library.png) of Owlite Academy, as it is located in the Candlestick Keep.

- `The Spookats of Moorcroft Manor have another valuable piece of intel for us that is worth investigating. They say that a lost soul of the former Kingdom of Almire resides in a soldier's graveyard near the Firestorm Citadel. This soul is willing to provide us with the information on the nature of the citadel as well as how we can get through it and reach the Core` ([Alone in the Dark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alone_in_the_Dark)).

  It contain both remains of Owlite Academy, the Candlestick Keep, and cooling chambers of Clockwork tunnels.

- The [Gauntlet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet) itself is accessed through the Owlite Academy, transitioning, again, into the Scarlet Fortress.

  This time, notably, the castle, as the Gauntlet, contains most of the high-tech hazards, attributed to gremlins, - the [freeze traps](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Freeze_Trap.png) of cooling chambers and [fire traps](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Fire_Trap.png). This was covered in the [gremlin containments section](#gremlin-containments-and-consoles). And here, we see more relation to the heavenly kingdom, as if it was, in fact, surrounding the Citadel.

Here we have to return to the topic of the [Forgotten Time](#analysis-of-forgotten-time), as there we have discussed the possibility of Almire existing on the same planet as heavenly kingdom.

This positioning does raise suspicions, geographically. Through mythological inspirations, heavenly kingdom had to be located above the land of Ironmight Kingdom, tortomega ruins, including the Wildwoods and the [Veiled Homeland yet-to-become the Aurora Isles](), and the Kingdom of Almire.

As the planet had to be harvested, Aurora Isles would have to eventually end up being captured, but this would not explain the fact they, too, float. Unless the same technology or physical law was used to hold up all of matter in skydomes.

We have mentioned that Carnavons and Slag Zombies have similar design and are only ones with explicit armor. One particular concept we are interested in - _if Carnavons are canon, their curse affliction and Dread Seals are canon, would this make Shadow Firestorm Citadel canon_? And if so, how would it fit with the existing Firestorm Citadel outside of Shadow Lairs? Physically, all of those location reach Shadow Lairs proper - the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage), - as only boss depths contain the first signs of the Swarm, the rectangular black mist, that is apart from the Gate Icon in prior depths.

Assuming Owlites, as the heavenly kingdom above the mountains, had witnessed the war of 3 kingdoms - Ironmight, Almire, and supposedly Raiders, - they had to stay away from the conflict given lack of their presence. Then Lord Vanaduke has returned from the mountains with the Legion of Ur - of Isoran Wardens transformed to trojans.

As the Legion of Ur had returned into the mountains, and subsequently, Underworld, as most of the land was burned by Lord Vanaduke's crusade, we have proposed, that state of matter became the reason for Valkyries to invade the Underworld.

This period of time and until the Kataclysm had seemed fitting to position Owlites' gunslinger priests, as both those narratives involve undead opposition or danger to heavenly kingdom. It is also in this context we have proposed existence of undead kingdom of Almire as the [Almirian Empire](#almirian-empire).

As far as our hypothesis has allowed, Lord Vanaduke could've begun an invasion into the heavenly kingdom with his undead army of legions of Almire. It is then, either to greater developments in the understanding of curse were made, allowing for Dread Seals to be placed onto carnavons, or, those advancements had followed near the Kataclysm, with a _different party responsible for placement of those Seals in the modern times_ in the paradigm of those Seals belonging to Owlites.

There is also a chance of Valkyries being Isorans in nature, which itself relies in the idea of Isorans possessing a skeletal structure, but, in terms of this theory, we will follow with the complete disappearance of Owlites and Valkyries as the same species.

##### Dread Seal: Part 2

Through this logic we reach the Dread Seals and ones who bear it [for the second time](#dread-seals).

Dread Seals are acquired from the [Katastrophe Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Prize_Box), meaning, that it is associated with Owlites, to a degree. In the accompanied [news art](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/News/2014), dread seal is placed on the Black Kat Mask, - reminiscent of Margrel, as the [Cowl](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_kat_helm) is acquired from him and Margrel bears the seal on his forehead.

No less important the fact that it is in a set with the Chaos Cloak. Weather or not this design choice is canon, the fact that evil eye makes itself present on Owlite's Chaos Cloak may serve as a link to other Owlite researches regarding nature of curse, as discussed in detail starting from the [Kat Tribe chapter](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

As the Chaos Cloak is forbidden, the dread seal placed with it seem to suggest it being a mark of danger, or a restriction. As discussed earlier, __Dread Seal's design is closely similar to the known design of the Fu talisman__, _meant to hinder a supernatural entity_. It is placed by a priest. We have assumed those priests being the gunslinger priests of heavenly kingdom, of originally valkyries, as those a deeply connected to concept of divinity. If those were not gunslinger priests in particular, Valkyries in general, as a civilization, are closely associated with divinity through terms like paradise and heavenly kingdom.

Then it is the roster of the [Katastrophe Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Prize_Box) which we have to discuss. Items, attributes to Margrel due to their design all have "Dread" used to characterize them:

- [Dreadful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreadful_Aura#Dreadful_Aura)
- [Dread Wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Wings)
- [Dread Seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal)

Dreadful aura and wings possess a design, which is loosely reminiscent of trojans, - of a cracked, stone-like form, with pink curse glow from within. But the distinctive feature of Margrel's undead form is the shivering and dark purple color, characteristic of all Black Kats, which makes the dread design to belong to Margrel and meant to be associated with him.

Yet, the above point of a relation to trojans makes sense, but in a different context, - as a _pattern or a trail of curse's involvement_. As far as common design patterns related to curse go, trojans follow them with 2 exceptions: their color is bright pink and they don't inflict curse.

As Undead family of monsters is affected or imbued by the curse, Black Kats, Margrel most prominently, and Carnavons, are ones to be empowered by the condition. And Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, but he lacks the seal present.

Then, there is [Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust). It has the seal, yet its color is different, more __sickly pink__, with [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust) being the closest to trojans' color of flames of bright pink. This sick color of pink is reminiscent of the dread cracks left of dread aura - which __might mark it as one of canonic manifestations of curse in the material realm__.

Given application of Crest of Ur in Gran Faust, symbolically, we might have to reconsider trojans as not only transformed Wardens, but curse-bearing, [semi-sentient fiends](#silent-legion), similar to [Darkfire Lord Vanaduke](#nature-of-darkfire), as suggested by his greeting of the knight as if the war was still ongoing: `
What's this? More wolves hungry for the blood of Almire? Our great kingdom shall never fall to the likes of beasts!` ([Firestorm Citadel - Throne Room - Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke)) and `He doesn't even realize that what he is trying to protect was lost a thousand years ago` ([Alone in the Dark - Final Resting Place - Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless))).

With the prior knowledge on Black Kats, Almire and [application of Dread Seal design in Owlite technology](#dread-seals), we will present the last argument in favour of dread seals being created by Owlites.

Carnavons possess __a painted dark-pink curse symbol on their blackened shields__. This is closely similar to the design of a cursed Isoran knight, as his gear - weapons, - are marked with similar, a proper eye symbol, albeit from a perspective of HUD, preventing usage of weapons. Presence of the dread seal on the front could be explained plausibly by its nature to restrict the curse, which seems as a benevolent action. And yet, the symbols on the back do differ and the color of seals themselves is different. Seemingly, one of those or both spells plus origin of Carnavons is responsible for its cursed state and capacity to _breath out curse_.

This act of protection would coincide with Owlites' actions of Warding Candles being placed, as another measure to defend against Underworld. We will also add here purification of Gran Faust into the Divine Avenger, as this is an act of turning curse into divine property.

In relation to Almire, the seal could be placed onto Carnavons to hinder them. _The only time this would chronologically fit, is when Owlites had to confront the undead Almirian Empire_, which conflicts with idea of Almire remaining as it is, without invasion of the heavenly kingdom happening. But, as much as this plot would seem fitting, _we do not see it as the case here_, as no evidence, apart from undead being present in the academy, there are.

As far as the setting allows, as presence of the seal is found on the Faust, whose color is practically unique, the __idea of Dread Seal being an Underworld development__ raises far less conflicts. This proposal we will explore next.

##### Color-coded Citadel

Dark Embers are acquired for Almirian Seal tokens, are said to be `salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time` ([Dark Ember](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember)), which would only be thematically fitting - through color purple, - if the entire Citadel was of that theme, so their presence in the regular fiery Citadel would be odd, or implying existence of the shadow variant.

But, it is the only this distinct evidence of, supposedly, darkfire existing outside of Shadow Lairs and color of fire in the fire bowls.

It was previously discussed that Vog's fiery curse, the reason for Vog Cubs' existence, is the other curse related to fire. Through this logic we followed to the idea of darkfire being a distinct phenomenon in the [nature of darkfire section](#nature-of-darkfire).

There, we have presented 2 proposal to the nature of darkfire - a regular by now variant of curse found across Underworld-adjacent regions of Clockworks, and a distinct creation emerging from Vog's curse being overtaken by different Underworld's curse. As darkfire would not have a reason to exist in the throne room engulfed by regular fire, which is a paraphrasing of the thematic inconsistency, if not framed into a context of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's mask curse-colored fire soul, as a distinct and unique phenomenon.

It was stated that army within the Citadel was transformed - that would eventually mean that all Slag Walkers had turned into Carnavons. Yet both are present across Clockworks outside of Shadow Lairs. Carnavons are summoned by Black Kats, which are themselves summoned by the dark ritual which can pull banished entities from the Underworld, such as trojans.

This, so far, creates 2 interpretation of the Shadow Firestorm Citadel:

- It is the latest state Citadel is found, followed by the events of [Shadowplay]().

  Carnavons being marked by Dread Seals here could be only be explained by, either:

  - Inhabitants of heavenly kingdom still existing in order to place those seals.
  - Carnavons existing prior to present events, which would contradict the idea of regular Firestorm Citadel.

  Or, dread seals are of Underworld's origin, being applied by fiends onto creatures within the material realm.
- Shadow Firestorm Citadel is an anomaly unexplainable by currently known logic, existing in parallel to Firestorm Citadel.

    The 2 issues of this explanation come from the idea of Lord Vanaduke being potentially resurrected, and that an entire copy of the Citadel should exist on Cradle likely past its capture by the Core - which makes the Core and related to it entities to be related to a phenomenon of duplicate castles.

As both of those explanation are incomplete, we have to discuss 3 currently existing variants of the Firestorm Citadel in order to categorize most of their differences for our investigation.

##### Firestorm, Greenstone, Darkfire Citadel

To start off, there are differences between Firestorm, 'Darkfire' Shadow Firestorm Citadel, and 'Greenstone' Citadel of Shadowplay.

Designs of Greenstone Citadel and Firestorm Citadel are essentially the same. The _Overgrown Court has a part of Ashen Armory fallen to its depth_, which coincides with the general structure of Greenstone Citadel's less stable state, as it crumbles: `We all sensed the moment you defeated Vanaduke. The entire citadel shook as he fell and for a moment we thought that this realm would be destroyed along with its ruler. You must be careful wandering these halls with the place coming apart like this!` ([Shadowplay - Overgrown Court - Nature Sprite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court)). There is also a case of armory located below the Court, which would make the levels to change depths, or ascent. But those nuances are unimportant currently.

There are notable elements within the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, which frame it in s similar light:

- Much larger in quantity presence of metal chains. All chains, both positioned in the same places as in the regular citadel and ones added in those depth are much larger. Those chains also possess a darker color, reminiscent of the Blackened Crest by its name.
- More arches present across the buildings surrounding the main area of depths, a less notable architectural change, but one that exists.
- Presence of wooden watchtowers and their usage as, seemingly, reinforcements for the brickwork structure of the buildings.
- Almirian tapestry in several instances across the Shadow Firestorm Citadel is much larger in scale, as the aforementioned chains.
- Most of fire bowls have their yellow fire replaced with purple, which we suggested to be dark embers and dark fire, as the same design is present in relation to undead locations, which also was a contributor to nature of darkfire as a regular phenomenon out of Underworld.
- Grim totems are more deeply integrated into the designs of Shadow Firestorm Citadels. They are secured by the brickwork itself.

  In both regular and shadow citadel, presence of totems is questionable, apart from game design perspective as undead levels. Unless, those were introduced by devilites, but in the Shadow variant of the Citadel they are far more evidently placed with a strategic purpose to assist perished undead almirians.

- Far more areas are blocked off by wooden and brickwork debris, areas, designated to specific depths or route variations in it, are collapsed in a haphazard manner, with extending passages being broken off.

##### Darkfire Lord Vanaduke and <span class="through-curse">Damnation through curse</span>

Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's design _differs greatly_ from Lord Vanaduke of Firestorm Citadel. More so, we have to keep in mind 2 interpretations of `His soul bound to some horrific armored prison` ([Alone in the Dark - Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue)): of `some horrific armored prison` being aither the citadel, or the armor Lord Vanaduke has equipped.

As we study Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's design we notice several design elements:

- One of the most notable element is presence of an _intact purple hooded cloak_ of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke.

    Almire's crest shown on its _back is most intact with an additional spiked design_, compared to the torn as the [Almirian tapestries](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture#Doodads) cape of Firestorm Citadel's Lord Vanaduke.

- The clothes below Vanaduke's armor, as well as the cloak, have the same triangular pattern in the design of _not crudely sawn rags, but far more finely preserved royal clothes._

    This triangular pattern is most similar to Underworld's shadow steel patterns associated with Nefarious Imp and gear made of shadow steel.

    The hooded cloak ends with the triangular white-outlined shapes at the base of the black tree of Almire's Crest.

- The armor of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke has the similar thematic change. _It has no visible bolts nor connections and is generally more monolithic_. The only to distinct armor pieces are the face plate and the chest. While the characteristic chains had remained, they are now present all across the Citadel - the motif of chains seems to be a lot more distinct.
- The part of armor around the faceplate has a distinct symbolic elements, a __circle of outwards extending spikes, reminiscent of a star__ or normal damage projectile.

    We suggest it being related to a medieval device, iron maiden specifically, which by proxy becomes a prison for Lord Vanaduke's soul - a concept, first suggested in relation to the interpretation of the armored prison.

    Another interpretation to be found here, is of implications of the coins and emblem of [Ironmight Kingdom](#ironmight-shield-crowns-and-coins), referencing stars and seemingly reign over them. If the undead Almirian Empire did incorporate all of those kingdoms, then this would thematically be reflected in the designs, but it seems more of coincidence.

    Other suggestion, is, yet again, a relation to depiction of start - a [Spell Book](). Its design is similar to the [tome of rage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_Rage), but instead of a symbol of alchemy, it is a star on the cover with a gem within. Back of the book has depiction of the Moon, which alludes to a Sun and Moon duality of Cradle's Equinox - _a celestial theme_. This still allows us to interpret armor's pattern as one meant to invoke images of a star, but why?

Whose factors considers, we propose, that Lord Vanaduke's soul sis indded, as implied by the [Lost Soul of Almire](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue) - `His soul bound to some horrific armored prison`, - is __bound to this very armor__.

So, an unknown party had applied a curse onto the Citadel, which influenced the resulted state the Citadel is found in the Shadow Lairs, _one far more fortified and dilapidated than it was found_ during [The King of Ashes]().

Then there is presence of Almire-aligned undead, including the royal guard - they, too, had to be justified to be present only in the Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

All of those elements make __Shadow Firestorm Citadel far more authentic, compared to the Firestorm Citadel outside of Shadow Lairs__. Presence of Dark Embers following curse theme should be a reason for this variant being the 'true one', an yet, Greenstone Citadel has all of the initial designs of the Firestorm Citadel.

Due ot those properties we will expand upon the explanations presented in previous section, and present a 3rd scenario of integrating the Citadel into the timeline:

- Shadow Firestorm Citadel symbolically represents the Citadel of the undead Almirian Empire at its prime state.

    Shadow Lairs, through an unknown actor, through transformative power of curse, had transformed present Firestorm Citadel into one completely overtaken by the curse, transforming Almirian designs into fiendish.

    Presence of still cursed Vanaduke's finery would suggest, that Lord Vanaduke's soul still lingers, and this would've allowed for it to be brought back into fiendish armor, paralleling trojans' design, contrasting Spiral Wardens, and, in terms of resurrection - Margrel.

- Shadow Firestorm Citadel is one traversed by the knights, placing it before the mission of King of Ashes, as Lord Vanaduke is required to live at this point in time.

    This approach would discard the event of the mission itself, rendering them not canon, _negating entire story arc_. This approach would also contradict the boss trophies, as all of them do not account for Shadow Lairs, while the regions themselves were seemingly pulled to the higher depths. Lack of the Console is also an important contradiction of this proposal.

    This seems less likely. It is due to implausibility of such scenario, despite conflict presented by Dark Embers, we are considering the idea of a time when carnavons were marked as such in the past, but with the curse affecting the Citadel in the modern times.

Lastly, we should note a possibility of _purple-colored Dread Seal being attributed to Underworld_ - as Faust, - and only gold seal belonging to Owlites, derived from the dread seal. __This would remove altogether a necessity for Carnavons to be marked with the seals by heavenly kingdom__, apart from their presence with Kats and populating the Academy. Given lack of any mentions of such war taking place, we would consider it as nonexistent.

As for dark embers, - in this interpretation, they would remain as an outlier, but now explained as a characteristic element of cursed corporeal entities met by Vog's fires, with darkness present only in the innermost regions of the source of curse - in proximity of Lord Vanaduke, as it would reveal the nature of the affliction as Underworldly not in Darkfire Lord Vanaduke's design, but description. This still seems as an unfulfilling explanation, but one, which can be attempted to be drawn into a predefined metaphysic system.

Existence of Dark Embers would be justified, if it is meant to be acquired by the time Darkfire Citadel was traversed. This would also _link back with the themes seen so far, of Undercorp being the perpetrator, responsible for the curse of the Citadel_ on the greater scale, concentration, and intensity [compared to the miasma]().

In this case, __the potential revival of Lord Vanaduke__, suggested by his lingering presence in boss trophies - of his mask, paralleling zombie's skulls, __rebinding of his soul to a specifically crafted armor of Shadow Steel, yet with the original mask__ would seem as _a showcase of extreme means Undercorp would go,_ and as evidence of the [mask being container for the soul](). But those are the means, we are only vaguely aware of the ends, which had to be connected to the existence of the Swarm later.

Given the very existence of this proposed notion, Undercorp had to be connected to the Core, and supposedly the source of energy with the ends of accessing directly the souls used to be gathered and routed into the Apocrean Realm through Underworld, as we have suggested during [our analysis of the paradise]().

At that, the only time such scenario would be plausible, is _after the events of Shadowplay_, as there are, we believe, several arguments for this:

- `Firestorm Citadel continues to burn with accursed flames. Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power. Spiral HQ requests that you gather together a crack squad of knights and return to the collapsing ruins of Firestorm Citadel in order to discover the source of the disturbance` ([Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay)).
- `We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. It's coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it` ([The Flickering Flame - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame))

Those factors, despite the fact the Artifact is placed by Herex after the knight arrives to the Console, serve as the foundation for the link between Artifact's energy and its influence onto metaphysics of curse, powering it in the same manner as the energy contained within the mineral serves as the conduit and a battery.

Due to the Artifact remaining in the Console, we propose, that it is its influence, paired with opening of the Core, and later timely involvement of Undercorp, which had led to the result of Firestorm Citadel becoming even more cursed, but now repurposed directly for Undercorp's plans on Cradle and status quo of Core opening.

Yet, this explanation would not resolve the issue of the arrival from the Sanctuary to the sealed version of the Core. We suggest this design choice being only the result of an unfinished rank missions' story, as suggested by the ending of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares). More so, the only Core mission being far easier in contrast to the Shadow Lairs seems as if the true endgame was yet to come, which would justify Shadow Lairs' endgame material, difficulty, and equipment as fitting.

#### Evil Eye Appearances, Themes, and Curse

Now, We will reiterate upon all instances of evil eye and curse in general. We will attempt to identify properties and patterns based on the established narratives and reasonable implications, observed across the timeline up until this point.

Symbol of the eye, [dread seal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal) and symbol of curse within the status effect classification of Spiral Order all have similar designs, which can be summarized as a _an opened eye with 3 strokes or dots below in radial pattern._ Occasionally, one dot or stoke above the eye is seen.

This design is similar to the _Hand of Fatima or Eye of Miriam_, which in its most common form is shaped like a hand with three extended fingers in the middle and a curved thumb and pinky fingers on the sides. Here, it seem to possess an inverted effect within the Spiral Knights cosmology.

Another potential inspiration for eye's design is prominent presence of the particular [eye symbol](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_Symbol) across _Legend of Zelda setting and franchise_. While it is also _hypothesized to be inspired eye of Horus_, as the evil eye of Spiral Knights, the potential notion of the prior serving as an inspiration for the latter is plausible due to at least one inspiration from a different game: `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right. Thank goodness we hired Cory!` ([10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773)).

As most of instances of curse are connected to Underworld and depictions of the evil eye, those will be covered first.

- For the first time, evil eye is seen as a color pattern on [Greavers' wings](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver).
  - Elemental Greavers have the pattern glowing in accordance to their elemental theme and status effect, apart from the curse itself, which as a common motif, not seen explicitly.
  - Greavers have metal helms with an eye as a visor, which we proposed to be a common design across legions of Underworld, connecting it with the Nefarious Imp.
- Tortodrones' shell plates have evil eye carved on them, possessing a red glow in enraged state.
  - Artificially derived [tortodrone shell gear](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell) has mineral-related glow of those eyes.
- Graviton [Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb) has a symbol of an antique evil eye carved on it. The explosion of the bomb resembles the grim gate's opened portal vortex, without leading to dark city, instead having a dark core. The vortex is then followed by an explosion with an imagery of an antique evil eye.
  - Similar vortex resulting of the explosion is present in [Grim Gates](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Fiend_Gate.png) during their portal collapse, but this instance has presence of curse-colored vortex, identical to maelstrom of dark ritual in Moorcroft Manor.
  - Presence of Margrel is characterized by the the aforementioned case of the maelstrom of curse supposedly pouring from the Underworld and a location wherein Black Kats did come from.
- Antique evil eye in present on [heavy statues](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png). They have troika-like weapon and helm in its shape resembling a devilite, with a characteristic single eye.
  - Evil eye symbol is seen on the titans of the titan arcade gates. We concluded tat the statue and titan are the same entity.
- Snarbolax is cursed, but has it contained within its fur, which grants it its defenses and ability to exist and haunt after death. It has themes of haunting and supernaturally seeing eyes.
- [Nefarious Imp raiment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Raiment) and [hood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood) have highly advanced designs incorporating a more abstract version of evil eye imagery.
  - That armor, helm specifically, has a glowing symbol of evil eye similar to [Gran Faust](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust).
  - Same advanced shape was seen on Gran Faust and Faust guards.
- A 90-degree rotated antique evil eye is depicted within the front cloth pattern of the Chaos Cloak. Chaos Cloak has themes of curse being seemingly a part of universal whole within Nameless Realm.
- The dread seal contains image of the evil eye.
  - Dread seal is present on [Carnavons](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Carnavon#Carnavon), warriors of Almire. Their bear similar concentrated degree of curse as Black Kats, their claws are of dark matter form the supposed influence of darkfire - merging or Underworld's curse and Vog's curse into a single phenomenon.
    - [Darkfire Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkfire_Vanaduke) has same dark matter claws, and is immortal, while being maddened, cursed by the fiery deity Vog.
  - The Seal is also present on [Margrel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel), in addition, [black kats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat#Black_Kat) being both summoned ([1](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation), [2](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals)) - the former are summoned all across known Clockworks and Margrel is summoned through a [dark ritual](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals).
    - [Mewkats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mewkat#Mewkat) are closely related to black kats as both being grimalkin transformed into Undead - a parallel to citizens and legion of Almire.
    - [Grimalkin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mewkat#Grimalkin) emerge in areas covered by an unnatural darkness, one being related to Underworld through Philoso's research of Undead.
      - Research of Undead was possibly performed by Titans before discovery of Underworld proper.
  - [Seraphynx the Black Kat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Black_Kat)#Gallery) battle sprite transformed by the Core has the same Seal present under certain conditions of evolution, combining divinity of heavenly kingdom and curse-aligned nature of post-Kataclysm Kat Tribe.
- [Trojans](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan), including Arkus have dark matter crystal embedded, trojans of tier 3 and resurrected Arkus have the crystal burning in pink flame.
  - The purple flame is closely related to [Dark Embers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember), the latter is related to Lord Vanaduke's curse, Underworld.
  - Trojans and corrupted tortodrones petrify once the dark matter inside is destroyed, releasing purple mist, similar to [Baleful Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Baleful_Aura#Baleful_Aura).
  - Trojans [were sealed in the Underworld](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur) but do not possess the dread seal, an idea of the seal devised in the Underworld.
  - Undead [Dreadnaughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreadnaught) can inflict curse while being not a curse-ridden entities, but they are linked through power to resurrect to the grim totems.
- Apocrea, while without evil eye symbolism, is an entity of shadow damage and an eldritch god, with similar futuristic designs of the city, close to ones of Nefarious Imp armor, yet without sign of curse present within.
- Explicit curse seals forbid some of abilities of a sealed entity.
  - The [Cursed Nature Sprites](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court) could not establish a link to Spirit Mother and its realm.
  - Curse placed on Knight disallows it to inflict damage.
  - Seal and curse-afflicting attacks of of [Black Kats](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel) may symbolize their banished nature, or, as recently discussed, connection to Undercorp.
  - Seals of [Sealed Sword](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword) restricts its power output.
  - Seals on Lumbers, apart from void lumbers, as they lack the seal, hide the essence which might power the tree trunk through tethering of a soul or an elemental essence, sealing it within the mechanical components. This essence if dropped on host's defeat.

Entities imbued with curse last far longer under unnatural means and have amplified power compared to their nature prior to being afflicted with curse:

- Lord Vanaduke and Darkfire Lord Vanaduke, Margrel, black kats, carnavons, trojans - generally live for more than thousand of years.
- In some instances they are resistant to curse: devilites and Vanaduke, fiends in general.
- Armors and gear explicitly related to Underworld and curse of their owners are weak to curse, while items related to divinity are strongly resistant to curse. The latter are often presented as divine or holy.

In relation to gremlins, gremlin technology and Clockworks:

- The [Collector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Collector) has antique evil eye drawn around its central eye, and backpack of bombs has the sigil with the eye.
  - [Lumber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber) created by gremlins have paper seals placed onto them, the same sealed sword is wrapped in.
    - Lumbers drop essences. Although this could be thematic feature for the sake of loot table consistency of tier 3.
  - Collector's backpack has the same symbol as echo blocks, which also contain a depiction of an eye.
- The Swarm has a similar eye [pointing downwards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed).
  - Core's enemy onslaught [gates](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond) have evil eye present of same curse-themed color of dark pink and purple, with an iris of larger size.
  - Core's respawn pads have 3 dots, similar to 3-dot eye of Apocrea of Underworld and Scarabs.

As for the immortal explicit bearers of curse:

- Darkfire Lord Vanaduke

  - Inflicts curse: Yes
  - Lightning arcs: Yes (when disembodied mask)
  - Burning: Yes (limbs, cursed fire soul behind the mask)
  - Dark matter presence: Yes (claws)

  - Inflicts curse: Yes
  - Lightning arcs: No
  - Burning: No
  - Dark matter presence: No
  - Unstable form: Yes (baleful aura)
  - On defeat: melts, yellow explosions

Here would propose a concept which was partially referred to near the [analysis of the nature of darkfire](), since we have established a connection between trojans and Spiral Wardens.

What if the pink fire of trojans is indeed a separate, native to Underworld, manifestation of curse, hence the reason for its distinct separation from the purple darkfire of material realm?

If the Shadow Firestorm Citadel was influenced by the curse to the point of its fires in the fire bowls turning purple, why trojans had remains unaffected? Both this and the distinguished color, yet identical to charged dark matter, seems us as if trojans have become native to Underworld to the point of being __unaffected by curse as part of their nature__, similar to Greavers, whose symbolism of the eye does not correspond to them inflicting curse.

For the rest of species coming from the material realm, curse is the identified of them transitioning to the fiendish nature of Underworld.

The counterpart to curse - a concept of divinity or sainthood, is also found in [Saintly Silver Amulet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Saintly_Silver_Amulet), [Sacred Silver Amulet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Silver_Amulet) and [Blessed Silver Amulet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blessed_Silver_Amulet).

It is also here we should note on the sacred characteristic of 5-star upgrades of the [Padded Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor), with helms reminiscent of older ages. The descriptions also make if seems as if the __entire alchemy tree of Padded Armor, as it is designed for handgun combat - is the modern reemergence of gunslinger priests:__

- `A spectral suit of armor for those who are gunning for ghosts` ([Sacred Snakebite Ghost Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Snakebite_Ghost_Armor)).
- `A phantasmal suit of armor for those who are aiming for the infernal` ([Sacred Falcon Hex Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sacred_Falcon_Hex_Armor)).

Due to this, we believe, the eye represents more than curse itself, but presence of Underworld, which manifests itself in a causal manner through applications of curse as one ot its essentials. It is die to abundant presence of curse, the eye may be mistaken to represent curse. But we had to keep in mind, that curse itself is characterized by presence of Underworld in the material realm, leading to an aforementioned connection.

#### Metaphysical Restriction

The curse can be externally applied, which takes form of a metaphysic restriction placed upon an entity, such as:

- Cursed Nature Sprites are unable to establish a link to a different realm - Spirit Mother's Realm.
- A knight under curse can attack only through the attack backfiring.
- Seals placed onto weapons block or direct inwards part fo their power - prime example being Sealed Sword.
- Sealed entities - Carnavons, Black Kats, Lumbers, - are instances of this concept applied thematically and functionally. Only elemental Lumbers possess a seal, is attributed to essence or a soul keeping them operational within an artificially constructed body.

    Carnavons and Black Kats are marked by the seal, which, given their current condition, blocks so far unseen fraction of their influence onto material realm. Given [Dazzling Light Ray](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dazzling_Light_Ray#Dazzling_Light_Ray): `The ray of light deals extra damage to undead and fiend family monsters`, seal's function can be interpreted as one forbidding greater damage to species of material realm, or, in a more recent interpretation, attributing it to Undercorp, _a tool to tether the soul outside of specificity of Cradle's metaphysics._

A restriction manifests through application of a seal, in a most basic form, as seen on elemental lumbers and Sealed Sword, it restricts the function of an object, and, as with lumbers seem to tether a soul to a corporeal body. A more advanced usage - as the apparition of a seal, - is seen through presence of the Dread Seal, placed onto Carnavons and Black Kats.

##### Tortodrone's Case and Gorgofist

A more nuanced relation of curse and constructs is seen in tortodrones, whose shell hides charged crimsonite or dark matter. Given previous motifs, we propose, that carved eyes on the shells are meant to surround the power pistons and contain the mineral as it is drained as power source by the pistons.

In case of corrupted tortodrones, due to presence of dark matter, and tempering by Undercorp, a more advanced method of containment is used - that of ritual circle devised to contain the encircled object. As mineral pillars are secured by sigils within a pentacle, so those sigils are carved onto the shells. Given case of lumbers, the prior technique seems less developed, as it was used primarily by civilization of material realm, see the case of Faust and Sealed Sword.

So, we settle with an idea of fiendish, more complex mechanism of securing mineral, power source, through the system, derived from The Key of Solomon the King, rather that simpler creating of rudimentary seals.

The role of Gorgofist than starts to make sense - this is a dark matter weapon, but it lacks sigil carvings, instead possessing eyes of ancient shells - as it is not devised by Undercorp, but, most likely, reverse engineered.

#### Physical Transformation

The more curse is integrated into nature of an affected entity, the more this entity becomes detached from properties of material realm and approaches the nature of Underworld, going through a process of transformation of a body, but not of the soul. The body in the Underworld is malleable, as suggested by origin of gorgos. The soul is universal, as it is the medium of energy.

From those entities which are most affected by curse, we believe, are trojans of legion of Ur, Arkus, Black Kats, and Lord Vanaduke. If the bearer of the curse was dead, the soul would leave it, with only traces remaining, as discussed in [haunting section](#haunting). But, on Cradle the soul can be tethered to a body through external means, which we had concluded being the presence of the Core. There is also Underworld, which, through Undercorp keeps operating subtly.

This process of bounding of a souls for constructs is achieved though application of a seal, described above. It seems that the seal has the same property as Owlite texts, through presence of specific symbol, which by the fact of being written, grant the underlying matter power across multiple realms. Same can be thought of the fiendish ritual circles, as their pattern defines their properties and function.

The curse can be transformed into a heavenly magic, as seen in the Divine Avenger. Yet, in its nature, curse is natural. It is an essential element of Underworld and Nameless Realm, which is perceived as curse in the material realm due to differences of laws of physics between those realms.

#### Immortality through curses

In greater scope, evil eye is a sign of relation to Underworld, seen in such instances as Kat Tribe raiments and Collector's eye and explosion, which is reminiscent of the graviton and electron bombs.

In that interpretation and arising notion, before delving into the Swarm, the curse has a tendency of giving greater power and flawed immortality in exchange for the change in nature of said beings, aligning them with the Underworld.

The fiends themselves are immune to curse and incorporate it to the extremes as part of their physiology. Entities which incorporate [curse](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Curse) to the fullest are weak to piercing or celestial/divine damage originating from Heavens, contained in the refined [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore) - [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver), as they are identified as fiends.

Presence of the Celestial Ore and Sun Silver highlights the widespread presence in the material realm. It is the nature of Heavens which lies at their properties. The celestial, heavenly theme originates from the Nameless Realm or the realm Sprite Mother exists, it is the origin of souls and auras, which are the concrete cases of universal medium of energy, emerging from crystal and mist energy.

This energy flows from the upper Nameless Realm, settles in the material realm, and souls, after death of a host, depart into the Underworld. Within it, Apocrean Realm, Underworld proper and Blinding Abyss are all sustained by souls, or the energy.

Due to this, it is the universality of energy which grants immortality, binding through curse a soul - a pocket of energy - to a corporeal body, allowing it to be _reanimated indefinitely_. Lingering of a souls manifests as shadow damage, as it is directed by an undeparted soul, with the body being a physical actor.

#### Alchemical Transmutation

The thematic duality of chaos and nothingness is most present in dark matter mineral and Nameless Realm. Through this duality, curse is disregarded as any other natural phenomenon, one conforming to alchemical transmutation and laws of the universe.

The theme of this duality will be explored in the next chapter, fully deriving from alchemical meaning.

It is then established how curse manifests itself in the material realm. So far we have seen a large set of possibilities of curse being applied or manifested. But, what if this concept to be expanded upon by asking a following question.

How would curse manifest itself, if it to be presented to the Nameless Realm directly - how this concept of metaphysical restriction would behave itself when introduced to physics of a realm, which is supposedly the source of all energy, the foundation of the Universe and a raw material/energy for souls to manifest?

### _Chapter `IX` Part I &#160;<br>_ Gremlin Empire


  <div class="decorate-contents">
    <img class="decorate-contents-img" src={imgGremlinEmpire} />
  </div>
</div>


Across the analysis we were noting different elements of gremlin technology, society, and what came of them. But in order to attain the fullest and deepest understanding of gremlin civilization, we need to analyze its history from several different perspectives in the similar manner as our previous discussions regarding valkyrian, titan, devilite, Isoran, and Owlite civilizations.

#### Iron Law

We begin with the Great Colony and its relation to Iron Law. Most of the general and relatively direct trivia regarding gremlin civilization's past and present is found in Haven, as well as from a few other places. But, due to unreliability of the sources, we have to come off a position, where those source are only half-truths.

- `Emberlight founded by Gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins` ([The Lab - Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).

    Emberlight is a town in Clockworks. There is a correlation between idea of Iron Law and hostility towards Spiral Order. Moreover, the culture of banishment is presented here, mainly through disobedience to the Iron Law, which moves an individual to seemingly, bottom of gremlin social hierarchy, an outcast outside of the Great Colony.

    As we will explore [soon, there are seemingly other methods of punishment](camp-crimson), apart from banishment.

    The idea of those gremlins seen as traitors presumes that the term of a traitor is detrimental to a societal goal. [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/traitor) defines traitor as `one who betrays another's trust or is false to an obligation or duty`. With this, Iron Law seems to be instrumental to modern-day gremlin civilization, as going against it is considered treachery.

- `All gremlins belonging to the colony serve King Tinkinzar. Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks. It is our understanding however that the kind is never seen by common gremlins, but instead his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order, a fearful and zealous band of gremlins who alone share audience with the great king` ([Haven - Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)).

  We have to keep in mind, that a potential element of unreliability might be present here through the wording of `Tinkinzar is said to be` and `It is our understanding`.

  Form here on out we will branch into 2 scenarios of interpreting the idea of a king Tinkinzar, as we will later see: he can be a no more than a fabricated idea, a mythic figure, or as a historical figure, whose actions led to such impression to be created among Strangers.

- `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins. Not part of plan!` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).

    This assumes, that Iron Law is enforced by Crimson Order and supposedly, by the king as `his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order` ([Haven - Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)).

    Then there is a vague plan, significant enough for Emberlight to be a hindrance to it. We would speculate it potentially being related to Clockworks' purpose, given `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` ([Haven - Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)). But, a different suggestion can be potentially presented. As there is an established principle of being banished from Great Colony, with Emberlight being largest known settlement of ones not obeying the Iron Law, one can suggest the plan being only means for Emberlight destruction.

- `A village of outcasts, Emberlight serves as a refuge for gremlins who were banished from the Great Colony. Now they live humble lives, selling wares and repairs to passing travelers, always fearful that one day the gremlin king Tinkinzar would see fit to wipe them out entirely` ([Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight)).

  Here it is phrased as if Tinkinzar is still present and directly oversees the plan, mentioned by Pakrat.

- `We believe they are developing some kind of weeping they're calling 'Project R' that will be targeting Haven itself. Spiral HQ and the Strangers themselves are requesting that you investigate the matter given your performance in the Royal Jelly Palace` ([An Explosive Plot - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Explosive_Plot)).

    As Strangers and Haven seemingly existed not long enough to witness creation of Cradle, we have assumed them being alien species to the planet. But, as gremlin civilization had existed nearly as long, assuming them being at least partially responsible for Clockworks' existence, why only now, as the Knights have settles in Haven, it had to be targeted?

    If we consider that Haven was targeted only now, as Emberlight is supposedly under risk, and given hostility of Iron Law gremlins towards knights, seeing outcast gremlins as traitors, we would propose, that presence of Spiral Order is also a hindrance to those plans and purpose of Iron Law.

- `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade!` ([Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)).
- `Warmaster Seerus is the evil master of munitions within the gremlin's all-powerful Crimson Order. Thought to be the true mastermind behind the Roarmulus Twins and countless other gremlin weapons, he is the Crimson Order’s creator and supplier for their diabolical engines of war. Recon Knights under the command of Lieutenant Feron recently discovered Seerus’s ‘Grand Arsenal,’ his development center and storage facility for all his weaponry. Now, Feron himself is leading several squads of knights directly into the Grand Arsenal, with the intention of weeding out Seerus and destroying his war machines. Met with heavy resistance, Feron’s squads require reinforcements and Spiral HQ is sending you in to assist` ([Operation Crimson Hammer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2012-02-29)).

    This positions Seerus as one following either Tinkinzar's command, or the Iron Law in general.

- `A very convincing costume that makes the wearer look like a gremlin. its so convincing, you just might receive an invitation to the Colony!` ([Gremlin Disguise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Disguise)).

    The colony wih the capital "C" refers here to the Great Colony, as no other settle of an implied scope was established.

- `The Iron Law is Broken! The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth. Only Herex will prevail. Follow Herex and you will be spared` ([Spark And Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex: Danger Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Danger_Module:_Hidden_Hideout)).

    Here we are interested only in the nature of the Iron Law. But, compared to Seerus and Crimson Order in general, Herex's understanding of Iron Law seems to suggest it in some capacity is be broken, while Crimson Order, which, as we hypothesized, enforces it, is completely false, - or flawed in its existence or beliefs. This mindset seemingly stems from the _idea of the Order not acknowledging the "Truth" or the "Resonance"._

    While those terms are particularly vague as seen through the lens of Herex's unreliable narration, we are interested in a long term in the reason of this mindset, as we have assumed, that Crimson Order should've had most complete understanding of Cradle and Clockworks. So them being for an unknown reason "blind" to the "Truth" makes it more nuanced. Potentially, even in relation to cosmic horror motifs.

- `The Nine see all, hear all ... King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Engines of War]()).

    This presumes, that the Crimson Order is not the one enforcing Iron Law, but a mythical figure of a king. An interpretation of this relation can be of the terms of order and king being used within state's hierarchy, as a monarchy.

    Here, the Order is a formal body under patronage of a king, which also acts as a proxy for king's authority (`Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle` - [Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).

- `The Nine see all, hear all. Obey the iron Law` ([Built to Destroy! - The Roarmulus Twins - Crimson Order Terminal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/The_Roarmulus_Twins)).
- `Crimson Order Directives: It is the DUTY of every gremlin to repel the metal intruders! Every Gremlin must work to destroy Haven. Cradle belongs to us! Every Gremlin must remain LOYAL to King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order. The Iron Law must be obeyed!` ([Built to Destroy! - The Roarmulus Twins - Crimson Order Terminal: Crimson Order Directives](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/The_Roarmulus_Twins)).

    It may be seen as if Crimson Order was formed because of Isorans crash landing, but given existence of their insignia across multiple facilities, such as Camp Crimson, Grand Arsenal, and Compound 42, we believe it is rather the threat of Isorans is one of greater priority for Crimson Order.

- `Transmission: 'They continue to advance and thwart our schemes! How could they have discovered Project R? Why was there no advance warning of the attack?'; - 'Herex and his minions were supposed to be spying on them but they have vanished like cowards.'; - 'To defy Iron Law is to defy the Order! Track the traitor down. Herex will answer for this setback'` ([Built to Destroy! - The Roarmulus Twins - Crimson Order Terminal: Crimson Order Transmission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/The_Roarmulus_Twins)).

    Given the above context of the location and the preparations in regards to location Ironclaw Munitions Factory and nature of Roarmulus Twins, we can safely assume, that it is due to absence of Herex Spiral Order's operation to infiltrate the factory was successful.

    It is also here a connection between Iron Law and Crimson Order is further reinstated, with one essential to the other. Given the previous quote's connection of gremlins with Iron Law through loyalty, we also find affirmation of a link between King Tinkinzar and Crimson Order as the essentials.

    Isorans are referred here as `metal intruders`, which is reminiscent of Seerus quote of metal assassins: `Who sent you infernal, iron assassins? Was it Herex? It matters not.` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Engines of War - Seerus]())

With this information, we can outline basic premise and relation between those terms:

- A state of gremlin civilization on Cradle, centered at the Great Colony, reigned by Crimson Order and king Tinkinzar, is maintained through the concept of Iron Law.
- Within Great Colony, disobeying the Iron Law is considered treachery. It becomes an explicitly harmful act towards the state, as a breach of trust or loyalty.

    Through this, Iron Law is characterized as an instrumental element of Great Colony's reign. On the topic of a breach of trust, based on potentially delusional Seerus's quote - `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law`, - we can link act of treachery being considered as such, as it goes against the vision or global plans of king Tinkinzar by an act of disobeying.

- There exists an idea of a master plan, which is allegedly devised by Tinkinzar and enforced by Crimson Order within the context of Cradle.

    Under this directive, existence of Emberlight and Spiral Order in Haven is harmful to plan's execution.
- The Iron Law, based on Herex's perception and a position as member of Crimson Order, is suggested to be a tangible concept within the network of relations involving the Swarm and the Core.

    Based on this, we can conclude, that the idea of Iron Law being considered broken even by members of the Order would also be considered a betrayal, as Herex operates in secrecy (`Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` - [Crossing the Chasm - Journey to Haven - Recon Module: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)). Herex's actions are potentially left unnoticed up until the events of Operation Crimson Hammer, as acknowledgement by Seerus: `Who sent you infernal, iron assassins? Was it Herex? It matters not.` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Engines of War - Seerus]()).

The validity of the Iron Law itself bing true or false is not yet questioned here, but rather it allows us to understand basic idea behind the governance.

Due to unknown nature of this plan, the validity of the claim, that Emberlight's existence could harm it, creates at least 2 interpretations, distinguished mainly by the degree of false information being distributed across non-Crimson Order gremlins, which, considering _general dystopian inspirations_, does seem as a potential assumption.

But, this could be also a case of unverifiable, unreliable information as Spiral Order is not familiar with gremlin's culture in details.

We also consider Herex's interpretation of Iron Law as broken to be truthful at least partially, as rooted in reality, rather than a complete delusion, [given latter eldritch horror motifs](#the-swarm).

With this, we can derive 2 general interpretation of the nature of Iron Law:

- Iron Law is a form of suppression of any state outside of Great Colony and distinct clans. Crimson Order considers Iron Law truthful while being unaware of its false nature, embodied by an implied relation of Herex and the Swarm.
- Iron Law is devised with the complete understanding of Cradle and Clockworks by the ruling party, Crimson Order and the king.

We will keep those 2 interpretations in mind while attempting to apply them to other elements of gremlin civilization in order to see how they would work in this framing.

There is one more conflicting interpretation of the term Great Colony, which we will hold off until the analysis of the [mending rune](#mending-rune-and-gremlin-emblem). Until then we will consider Great Colony as a literal location.

As we have not heard of gremlins in the context of other civilizations, we can make a plausible explanation for it being the fact that those periods of time _had happened prior to their incorporation into Cradle_. But it is unknown weather Cradle is as old as those civilizations - are Clockworks as old as, for example, heavenly kingdom or tortomega?

If gremlins are to be considered one of the more technologically advanced civilizations to date, on par with urban occult setting of devilites, [represented as Undercorp](), [heavenly kingdom of valkyries]() with [Owlite Academy](), and [Almire](), - gremlins, through Clockworks, had managed to connect all of the above civilization despite lingering existential threats within each epoch.

Based on the quote `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` ([Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue)) we have to assume that Tinkinzar came before Clockworks and subsequently Cradle. Yet, it is due Pakrat's recount of events it is known that a many years had passed since one saw the king: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle` ([Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue)).

Based on this information already we believe that either:

- Tinkinzar is far older than it might be expected of gremlin species. We have made such conclusion based on the phrasing Pakrat uses, as if Tinkinzar was still present in the past but after Pakrat was born.
- Tinkinzar is a fabricated figure, whose longevity or even immortality from before Cradle makes him close to a deific imperial figure within gremlins' Iron Law and Great Colony.

But, despite those differences, one element of those connections seems to us rather consistent - __Iron Law represents official gremlin ideology__.

It is then a basic relation of three concepts can be established: of king Tinkinzar as the monarch, Iron Law as the operational principle, an ideology, and Crimson Order as the arbiters of king's will and of the ideology.

##### Implied Time Periods

We will return to a different interpretation of the king within the analysis of Crimson Order, but currently, we have to consider this time discrepancy as a played straight argument in favour of our explanation of events of [Ghost in The Machine] and [unresolved ancient existence of laser technology in battlepods](), and subsequently, to first explanation of Tinkinzar as a real figure.

So, this idea of a assumed to be immortal king also ties in with a concept, first established during the [analysis of Ghost in The Machine danger mission](#ghosts-in-the-machine), - that Ironclaw Munitions Factory is the assembly line for not only Roarmulus Twins but other technology, specifically shock-themed lasers, the same ones present on Big Iron battlepod. [This battlepod secures the bridge of Isoran Vessel in the Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine). This large time span is based of the fact the bodies of space jockeys to that point had turned to dust, haunting the space vessel, while gremlins had to contain in in the Dry Docks with their own machinery, primarily mecha knights.

##### Great Colony as an Imperial Colony

Then there is the name of Great Colony. Great Colony can be characterized as gremlin capital in a general sense, based of the known clans and depths, but disregarding a possibility of a greater scope entity, as none was currently presented. Considering the time spans we are working with, some evidence of gremlins' presence on Cradle had to be established from the very beginning of Clockworks construction, so the Great Colony must be one of the oldest developments.

We propose, that the name itself here suggests _that Great Colony is a literal colony, a colonial domain on a distant planet - that of Cradle,_ - meaning, that there exists a gremlin interstellar empire with a remote metropole, to which Great Colony had to belong, rather than a civilization relegated to single planet of Cradle.

As Great Colony is one of more significant locations of gremlin civilization on Cradle, and considering how ancient are Clockworks themselves, even taking in account that gremlins were implied to be assisted in its construction - `Some say the gremlins that you see working on it now are responsable. But that seems too great even for their seemingly infinite work force` ([Plinkop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plinkop#Dialogue)), and `if we are to believe that indeed a lost kingdom from the past has somehow wound up in a massive mechanical world in present day, the question remains, why? its all a bit too convenient. But do gremlins really have this kind of power? I suspect something more than even what they are capable of engineering` ([Eye of the Needle - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle)), - Clockworks should have been present at least by the time Iron Hulk was haunted.

More so, as Isorans are already an interstellar species, their questions of gremlin technology (`Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock` - [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb)) would make the latter in relation to Isorans even more advanced, allowing for the same if not greater degree of space travel.

Of course, there exists a possibility of Clockworks existing for thousands of years, which does seem more plausible, at lest if we only consider its scope being a planet, as then Strangers of Haven would not have any modern recounts of Clockworks beginnings: `"How old are the Clockworks?" - It is hard to know exactly as so much of what is within seems to hold their origin from different worlds. Some appear to be from realms of great antiquity, no doubt once home to innumerable old gods and creatures. This world is an unnatural one. What you see within it was never meant to be here. The great histories of so many worlds endlessly churning through the cogs of this great machine` ([Plinkop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plinkop#Dialogue)). That is, if their responses are taken at face value, and with an assumption that Clockworks had not appeared in a few hundred years, even with an assistance of currently unknowns third party, as Plinkop's and Kora's dialogues suggest.

We could analyze the location of Great Colony in the same manner, as we had attempted to understand what purpose Dry Docks serve and the architecture of Owlite Academy. But here, it is not the location itself is important, but rather an understanding of what had happened before current hierarchy of clans was established.

##### A Precursor Planet Before Cradle

Considering the scale of Clockworks, as they comprise most likely most of all known volume of the planet, we assume, that some foundation for their construction, the raw materials, had to be gathered somewhere - be it a different planets or the one from which initially the construction began: `Within a seemingly impossible machine all manners of alien worlds exist within the giant globes that endlessly churn through every floor. What purpose do they serve? And from where did these worlds come? Before the crash the Skylark performed a partial scan of Cradle's surface that revealed what appeared to be a landscape composed of enormous parches of disparate terrain. The Clockworks are a manufactured place, perhaps the worlds they contain are harvested from the terrain above. But how?` ([Recon Module: Gloaming Wildwoods - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)).

In the first case - `a landscape composed of enormous parches of disparate terrain`, we can appeal to the idea of many worlds being literally gathered, put together as Cradle, which may place Great Colony as the very first location of gremlin settlement.

The second case - `The Clockworks are a manufactured place, perhaps the worlds they contain are harvested from the terrain above`, can lead to Great Colony being also the first settlement, but within an environment of a single planet, that was harvested to build Clockworks form inside.

While those explanations have vague foundation based on the lack of information, they remove a dependency on an undisclosed planet, and at least, weave it into the general narrative, as the prior had to be incorporated into Cradle either way at some point in time under current chronology. Apart from this, the phrase: `The Clockworks are a manufactured place, perhaps the worlds they contain are harvested from the terrain above` seems to be too specific to be a speculation, rather than a plain guess, as most of those locations can be seen as completely unrelated.

But, due to prior 8 chapter, we are currently seeing __the idea of a single precursor planet, which had to encompass all of those civilizations, to be true.__

This planet had to contain most of the entities from the timeline: dragons, Owlites, Kats, kingdom of Ironmight and Almire. These include later discoveries of the Nameless Realm and Underworld. This proposal, then, would not conflict with epochs of kingdom of Almire. Despite a possibility of decoupling Almire's narrative and history from the rest, mainly from the origins of legion of Ur and the relation to heavenly kingdom of valkyries, mentioned forgotten time, it would not bring drastic changes to the timeline, as currently all of the Underworld-adjacent laws are not restricted by presence of the Core, apart from spirits returning to material realm.

#### Gremlin Physiology

As for gremlins, while the location of Great Colony remains unknown, we still can attempt to guess, what was life for gremlins in the past before creaton of Clockworks based on the current depictions of gremlins.

##### Gremlin Goggles

Gremlin goggles are by margin the most defining design element of gremlins apart from their anatomy, habitat and behaviors, consistent across all instances of gremlins independent of their rank, position, affiliation, or clan. All of known gremlin coats, which mostly correspond to clans and, presumably, depth - Tenderfoot, Ironclaw, Darkfang, Grinchlins, and partially Ghostmane, including ones in Emberlights and Haven, - they wear goggles.

This makes us think of a greater importance of goggles. We could suggest that underground conditions had taken generational effect on gremlin physiology.

Gremlins of Haven, such as Pakrat, [Nonna](), who is, notably, a ghostmane gremlin, Punch and Vise, they still wear similar uniform and have obscured muzzles with goggles or rebreether masks. Punch and Vise in particular have _Strangers' asymmetrical design of their masks_, which we can interpret rather lineary, as if those gremlins are in Havan for a long time, which would allow Strangers' culture and designs to be adopted by them.

Then, there is a separate case of Crimson Order member, Seerus, as he lacks any explicitly advanced equipment, preferring a rudimentary mask over goggles. The issue of our earlier suggestion of gremlins requiring goggles conflicts with Seerus's lack of goggles.

It is in case of Seerus, through the mask his eyes can be seen, which possess a quality unique only to him - _bright spiral eyes_. This, with perception of Seerus being described as: `Taking on ol' Seerus aye? Careful now, he's not right in the head. Proper imbalanced that one. He and I go way back, but not in any way worth remembering` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Lobby - Vise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vise)) by Vise, might be a design decision meant to convey Serus's character as-is, but, as for the actual explanation for the physiological differences explored to the level of detail we covered across the analysis, we could only rely on the purely design-driven explanation, rather than one rooted in the setting's metaphaphysics.

Yet, this does not negate the multifacted application of goggles for gremlins.

In the same relation to goggles, - Darkfang gremlins and Ironclaw gremlins have different designs of goggle lenses, as the prior is round, while the latter has slitted design. Tenderfoot gremlins and gremlins of Haven, Pakrat specifically, also follow Ironclaw design pattern.

Due to this, we propose, that the amount of sunlight has influenced this design. While there are artificial skydomes, a greater protection would be required from natural sunlight. And, as Darkfang clan inhabits the lowest Clockwork depth among major 3 clans, omitting Grinchlins, they would likely possess a less restricted field of view due to potential lack of light at their depth.

In this context, the events of [A Gremlin in Knead]() Emberlight cook, Groat's design _expands on goggle's configurable design_. As during the possession by [Dread Velvet](), Groat's goggles are identical to Darkfang gremlins', and after the possession, they obtain a slitted design, similar to Pakrat's. This can be connected to the possessor, as one disregarding Groat's physiology in order to perceive as much surrounding as possible.

In this regard we could attempt to link fur or coat color of gremlins to their inhabited depths, which would manifest in the idea of richness of color for gremlins corrsponding to presence of sunlights or light in general, leading to less contrast, more pale colors. Under this logic, we would postions more mysterious Ghostmane gremlins at the deepest depths of Clockworks, as tose have a reason to possess a characteristic of their mane in their name, compared to naming convention of clans.

###### Augmentation Scenario

The last element of the goggles we will suggest, but which leans heavily into speculation due to nature of the sources we had used so far: could it be, that in the context of Clockworks as a megastructure, goggles are designed to be augmentations of gremlins' vision capabilities?

As googles are mounted with no system to hold them in place. When observed in conjunction with the rest of accessories and equipment within the established design language, they possess a [greater level of detail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Goggles), emphasizing their importance.

The mounting, of course, can be explained by the same design system, but, as we have seen, in a setting, where nature of _mist energy was accounted and acknowledged at a mechanical level_, what are the chances of those smaller details to be preoperly explained?

While we do not have a concrete answer, the possibility of such scenario should be retained.

##### Day-Night Cycle of Skydomes

Presence of Sun and Moon plates within Clockworks' artificial sky of skydomes. The moon is identical to one on Cradle's orbit, as both have a characteristic spiral on the near side.

The fact those are located within Clockwork skydomes does suggest that those locations are built to house biospheres, when compared to regular Clockwork tunnels. But, apart from budget restrictions of the game, why would both celestial bodies had to be presented as ones of Cradle's star system, with all of the moving machinery accompanying it?

It is also within those skydomes gremlin facilities - the compounds, - are present on par with other stratums in archaeological sense, such as tortomega ruins across Aurora Isles in their different forms.

Based on those elements we can suggest that gremlins, as species, had to be either nocturnal or inhabiting planetary surface under natural conditions, - living below ground, as a cave-dwelling species. But then, presence of fur makes it an uncommon characteristic of such specie. It is also presence of a day-night cycle within the skydomes which would point to more natural conditions in the past, be it Cradle, a different planet, or gremlin homeworld, but one to allow gremlins to _consistently build artificial suns and moons, gliding on the inner wall of skydomes_.

Given the fact gremlin compounds, a term for the military facilities, are located in those skydomes, seems to indicate their trait of goggles as a later measure from potentially generational effects of living underground.

With this context in mind, we will now discuss entirety of known gremlin facilities.

#### Gremlin Military-Industrial Complex

As compounds are considered smaller gremlin facilities within skydomes, we have to address the more general notions, inspirations, and motifs of modern-day gremlin civilization.

Throughout the rank missions and the Arcade, several gremlin facilities are encountered, those are predominantly compounds, located within biospheres of skydomes, and rank-mission exclusive underground complexes. The latter, such as Camp Crimson, complex 357, and Grand Arsenal, share the same defense measures, such as _barbed wire_, _anti-tank concrete blocks_, likely serving the same purpose as _dragon's teeth_, and _anti-tank hedgehogs_.

Apart from those structure there are _production centers_ and _research facilities_, from which Ironclaw Munitions Factory and compound 42 stand out as the largest and well known.

We also have at least 2 types of numbered facilities: compounds and complexes. Their ownership within clans and members of Crimson Order remains vague, but will be analyzed further.

##### Mecha Knight Factories

One of more characteristic elements of gremlins was their skillful creation of constructs, such as battlepods, mecha knights, and gun puppies. We will return to gun puppies' designs later, as they were already present as creations of tortomega but now we will focus on mecha knights.

One of such factories is found during [Toy Soldiers mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers): `Recon Knights ... have discovered a mecha knight production facility close to Haven. Mecha Knights are believed to be gremlin-engineered sentries of the construct family that share many of the capabilities of a Spiral Knight`. This factory, as suggested by the layout of [Factory Floor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers#Gate_Map), is located within Clockwork tunnels outside of skydomes. Deeper into the factory the [Production Center](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers/Production_Center) itself is located.

The production center is represented by the battlepod surrounded by a hexagonal shield. As this shielding pattern is also present on modified Proto Shields:

- `A Proto Shield modified to provide some protection against fire` ([Emberbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Shield)).
- `A Proto Shield modified to provide some protection against shock` ([Circuit Breaker Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Circuit_Breaker_Shield)).
- `A Proto Shield modified to provide some protection against freeze` ([Frostbreaker Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostbreaker_Shield)).

We can assume this technology is understandable enough to be either adapted by Spiral Order, as they upgrade the Proto Shield with Clockwork material (`A small shield issued to all Spiral Knights recruits` - [Proto Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Proto_Shield)), or is a common representation of general protection to be created separate from gremlins'.

Given items such as [Circuit Breaker Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Circuit_Breaker_Armor) - `Armor with a hacked elemental core aimed at resisting shock. However, this non-standard modification creates other elemental weaknesses`, we consider the scenario of this shielding technology to be common among both Spiral Order and gremlins without its direct adaptation in the same manner as indestructible shields.

##### Heavy Weapons Facility: Sparkcaster and Sputterspark

The Heavy Weapons Facility is found during [Shocking Sentinel Sentries mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries) and is described as: `a secret weapons facility that according to the intel ..., could belong to a high ranking gremlin of The Crimson Order. It is heavily fortified by a small army of electrified constructs ... While it is unclear if this weapons stash actually belongs to a gremlin of The Crimson Order, it is no less worth infiltrating and neutralizing the weapons stash` ([Shocking Sentinel Sentries](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries)). The fact of its belonging is later confirmed by the dialogue between [Sputterspark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sputterspark) and warmaster Seerus of Crimson Order within the final floor of the facility: `The Sparkcaster Deluxe is almost stable, I promise. I need a little more time, Warmaster. ... It looks like time has run out, Sputterspark. You'd better hope your little toy works` ([Sputterspark and Seerus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries/Heavy_Weapons_Facility)).

The facility itself houses a stationary device referred to a Sparkcaster, whose purpose, judging by the second encounter during [The Great Escape](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape) in the prison [yard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape/The_Yard), is to hinder enemy movement on the frontlines by remote generation of artificial lightning from the rear.

Considering that the facility is marked as secret, it is plausible that Sparkcaster is of the same purpose as compound 42 of Herex of Crimson Order: `Production of Compound 42 is to cease immediately. While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` ([Compound 42 - Containment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), - that of Crimson Order member's secret research facility.

The second iteration of the device is labelled as Sparkcaster 9000 Deluxe. Considering that it is stated as a `triumph in gremlin engineering` ([The Great Escape - The Yard - Sputterspark](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape/The_Yard)), we may read it in 2 ways: a comical hyperbole for the narrative and an actual analysis of the device with all of known laws of physic in mind.

As we are analyzing and connecting everything, we will go with the latter option. Specifically, the sole act of the device casting relatively controlled lightning is deeply related to the principles underlying Clockwork Power Complexes and [other instances of summoning lightning](). We will return to Sparkcaster in that section later. But as far as the themes and contextual framing of Sparkcaster allows, we believe, it would not be a logical leap to suggest an inspiration from _20th century wonder-weapons_.

##### Test Labs

One of testing laboratories was found to contain schematics for Roarmulus Twins, or at that point in time, known only as Project R during the events of [Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack): `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by` ([Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack)).

##### Trap Chambers

Trap chamber is introduced in [Faith in Armor mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faith_in_Armor): `An apprentice named Wilks who had just arrived from a Rescue Camp has found himself in what Spiral HQ calls a 'Trap Chamber.' These levels of most likely gremlin design seem to be specifically built to trap and ultimately eliminate those attempting to explore the Clockworks`.

The [trap chamber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faith_in_Armor/The_Trap_Chamber) itself consists of several enclosed structures, connected by bridges.

##### Weapon Caches, Factories, and Munition Storages

Mission [Sewer Stash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sewer_Stash) establishes existence of weapon caches across Clockworks: `Intel suggests that once manufactured, weapons are moved out of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory and stored in secret weapon caches throughout the Clockworks. One of these caches has been uncovered in one of the Clockwork's wasteworks systems` ([Sewer Stash](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sewer_Stash)). That weapon cache contains instances of battlepods.

A decommissioned type of similar munitions storages and factories is explored through [Assault on Machine Shop 13](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Assault_on_Machine_Shop_13) mission - `decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines`, proving presence of factories across varying terrain.

##### Crimson Order Hideouts

Existence of Crimson Order hideouts is established during the events of [Spark and Roar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar): `An exceptionally high concentration of constructs has been found guarding an area of the Clockworks that Spiral HQ suspects could be a Crimson Order hideout`.

[Hidden Hideout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/Hidden_Hideout) presents itself as one belonging to Herex and later reinstated as such through symbolism of green Crimson Order insignia and presence of the Swarm.

Before actual facility around the hideout found in [The Bitter Battle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/The_Bitter_Battle), knights had to traverse a [march](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar#Gate_Map) and [tundra](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar#Gate_Map), referred as Cold March and Iron Tundra.

While Iron Tundra is a deconstruction zone and Cold March is a compound, we have to consider general theme of the hideout being a small facility of a member of Crimson Order deep in the frozen location, potentially in proximity to arctic circle, or, given context of Clockworks, [Cooling Chambers'](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cooling_Chamber) effects onto the surroundings.

The arena, [The Bitter Battle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/The_Bitter_Battle) depth suggests it being a proper road to the hideout itself, as it is built from a series of gates, connected by a single road. Notably, it is the last gateway, which has blown open fenced gates and blaring alarms.

The hideout proper in its design suggests it being personal quarters in case of emergency. The [size](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Hidden_Hideout.jpg) of the hideout is also of interest to us, containing a few points of interest:

- A yard with a Crimson Order insignia.
- Workstation with vials and an recon module.
- Entrance and exit elevators connected to the system of Clockwork gates.
- The cisterns and the main structural body behind the exit elevator. The location's design itself resembles gremlin town of [Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight), that is the hull of what is considered Clockwork tunnels is habitable and likely contains proper living quarters, which would suffice a few gremlins for a limited time, as it is first and foremost a hideout.

We also propose, that it is potentially a bunker, considering the metal beam extending upwards, suggesting a reinforced structure, similar to the deepest location of [Ironclaw Munitions Factory]().

##### Compound 42 and Slime Generators

As for the rest of military research facilities, there is compound 42, which specializes in production of bioweapons. It is described as: `a gremlin bioweapons facility deep within the Clockworks. It is believed that this facility belongs to a member of the Crimson Order known only as Herex. The Recon Rangers have been tasked with infiltrating the facility and uncovering the nature of Herex's bioweapons before they are put to use` ([Compound 42](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42)).

When it is infiltrated, it is discovered that Herex had already ordered to burn it, removing all of evidence of its existence: `Production of Compound 42 is to cease immediately. While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin. All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)). The poison with intelligence of standard bio-toxin question are the [toxoils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxoil).

The facility contains large storage tubes of green gel. Based on the quote `it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), we can make a working assumption that this gel content is the bio-toxin. But, this puts in question a natural origin of [toxoilers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxoil) and [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxigel). Regular [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxigel) and then oilers are both also found across locations, which does not seem to be connected to the compound.

At the last arena of the [containment](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment) 6 large tubes of orange gel are found in the end of the structure, several of which are seen to be leaking. We suggest those are the basis for oilers in order to produce what became toxoils. There are also 3 large leaking tubes of green gel on the west side of the structure, toxic gel, comprising toxigels.

During the event of [Vile Engine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine) mission lichens were also involved: `Somewhere below a level that lichens have taken to inhabiting lies a strange facility of unknown origin that seems to be used for the production of toxic slime monsters. The 'slime generators' are capable of rapidly producing slime monsters that then quickly populate nearby levels. Squads in neighboring levels have already reported overwhelming numbers of toxic slimes, making it impossible to lead expeditions beyond depth 23. It is time ... to infiltrate this strange facility and shut down production of these vile creatures. Any data that you could collect as their origin would be highly valuable to Spiral HQ` ([Vile Engine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine)). The generators are presented in the [Processing Plant](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) as 2 battlepods creating not toxic, but [quicksilver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver) lichens.

Considering past knowledge of Herex specializing in bioweapons, involving accidental creation or mutation of lichens in compound 42, an assumption could be made that this facility does also relate to Herex. Yet, this inconsistency of the [processing plant](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) itself will be kept in mind for the analysis of quicksilver lichens.

##### Chemical Plants

Existence of chemical plants is presented in the mission - [The Phantom Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask):`Rhendon is waiting for you in an abandoned gremlin chemical plant where reconnaissance has located a cache of missing battle sprites. Secure the sprites and clear the area of hostiles. You are authorized to use any sprites you secure in order to complete the mission`.

##### Maskeraith, Sunset Steppes, and Haven Mines

This location is of particular interest to us duw to being one where [Maskeraith battle sprites are recovered](#maskeraith).

The other notion, which was not covered in relation to Maskeraith's analysis is their location. As Seraphynxs were found to continue Kat Tribe's deed, we are left with Drakons and Maskeraith.

With the current framework, we propose, that Drakons have specifically settled in [Sunset Steppes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sunset_Steppes), as this area was also part of dragons' descendants - tortomega, specifically the part of larger shattered landmass of tortomega homeland.

As for Maskeraith, they are found hear the pile of bones within the facility. The facility itself in its design is similar to the Haven Mines, which are visited in Lockdown mode - with Clockwork tunnels being placed within the overgrown stone interior. And, as the facility is referred to as the [Creeping Cavern](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask/Creeping_Cavern), we can confirm, that the mines are also a subterranean location.

It is then the relation between poison, chemicals and undeath which is established here.

We have previously covered a supernatural/Underworld-related element both of frost, manifested as [Everfrost]() with its plots, and poison, as a hypothetical [Vile deity]() and themes of [Plague Essence](). As far as analysis goes, we can suspect a vague, but greater relation to Underworld.

As for the patterns within gremlin facilities, we can draw parallels to a different facility found during a [Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack), as this facility is also found within a toxic cavern: `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by` ([Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack)).

With this we can establish, based specifically on the descriptions, that a significant portion of Cradle has remained as-is - to be made of rock, - whose caverns were repurposed for, potentially, higher secrecy facilities.

##### Camp Crimson

Depth of [Camp Crimson](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector/Camp_Crimson) is one of 2 known facilities of a distinct design. While Camp Crimson is not seen from the outside, the other location, - complex 357, - was.

The camp within a proximity of an entrance, contains what seems to be rail tracks for the transportation vessels, resembling _armored trains_. Those vessels are armed with an artillery canons on the their roofs and contain barred cells within the hull. The entrance to the facility is characterized by a few bridging railroads through the gates into the proper facility.

The same cells are observed all across the camp, with a few placed within the metal scaffolding-like structures above and below the depth of a camp. The rails are also found leading up and into the fortified perimeter of [Grand Arsenal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Arsenal), and seen multiple times within it, spanning across the facility.

Entirety of the camp's site is structured as a highly secured location, with search lights, armored watchtowers, and barbed wire. Apart from those, a peculiar element of metal pillars is seen across the camp, explicitly noticeable near the exit elevator, with several metal pillars extending upwards with widespread usage of Crimson Order insignia. All of those designs are present both across Camp Crimson and later discussed complex 357.

It is unknown weather camps as such had operated solely as prisons, or were of worse purpose. Yet, as knights had arrived relatively recently, we can suggest that those structures were built within the context of clan and Crimson Order members' inner conflicts.

Then there are events of [Great Escape](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape): `Recon Knights have collected intel that has revealed the gremlin 'Crimson Order' has begun ordering gremlins to build makeshift prisons within the Clockworks where Spiral Knights are being taken and imprisoned. It is believed that these orders are coming in direct response to your destruction of the Roarmulus Twins. Further data suggests that these makeshift prisons are a temporary solution until a larger facility can be built. Spiral HQ however has no intention of these imprisoned knights staying long enough to find out`. The fact that this solution is suggested to be a temporary one, we can make a guess, that the earlier question regarding the purpose of Camp Crimson as a facility not restricted to an imprisonment, is probable.

##### Complex 357

Found at the end of [Crimson Chaos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos), [Complex 357](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos/Complex_357) is a highly guarded facility, and the only one across rank missions, whose surface entrance is explicitly presented.

While located within a gremlin compound within a skydome, the main building of the facility - its entrance specifically, - is very distinct by its design, most reminiscent of an _imperial style_:

- Its inner yard has a wide inclined ascent to the entrance.
- To the sides of the main road, patches of grass with trees, gun puppy statues, as ones found across the grounds of tortomega civilization are found.
- Largest to date amount of battlepods at the entrance is found. Contrasting to Grand Arsenal, those seem to serve as a defense measure of the facility.
- Crimson Order tapestry is seen on the armored front of the facility.

The gate icon of the inner facility, - the underground complex itself labeled 357, - is of the same image of a rocket utilized to mark depths, identified as the Ironclaw Munitions Factory. Weather this complex is a research or a production facility is unknown.

##### Herex's Infiltration of Complex 357

The contents of the facility - __the schematics__, - were crucial enough for Herex to infiltrate it prior to his actions regarding Crimson Order and intent to descend into the Core, as suggested by the recon module: `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` ([Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Recon Module: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357)). At that point we do not know the _purpose of those schematics nor their contents_.

The facility itself contains only poison-themed constructs, alluding to Herex's poison motif. We believe, it is a no less important matter of discussion, weather the facility belongs to Herex. There are a few issues with identification of those constructs.

To start off, it is due to the fact Spiral Order was monitoring the facility prior to it going silent.

The complex is described in the [Crimson Chaos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos) as follows: `Spiral HQ has been monitoring several known Crimson Order bases in hopes of intercepting one of their elusive high-ranking members. Recon knights assigned to watch one of those bases report that it has suddenly gone silent and have requested backup before investigating it further`. Then, a recon soldier bear the entrance elevator to the complex 357 reports: `We've been monitoring the base for weeks then it went silent. Quite suddenly. We're not sure what you're going to find down there. Our sensors show no active life forms`.

This suggests, that the events, identified as Herex's infiltration, had to transpire without any evidence of those happening at least on the surface of the facility. There are damaged battlepods, but we don't have enough information to suggest, that those were a result of an infiltration, although we believe it is likely, given general state of the facility.

While a speculation, the fact that 2 Ghostmane Stalkers are found at the end of the complex may imply, that the technology Spiral Order uses to detect lifeforms, does not work on camouflaged Stalkers.

###### Haven Lab Infiltration

But, there is another instance of Spiral Order detecting significant gremlin activity - during the events of A New Threat and the Collector:

- `And speaking of gremlins, we're starting to get an alarming number of reports of gremlins mobilizing in the Clockworks below Haven. We don't have too many details yet, but given the relations we've had with them so far, our guess is they're preparing for an attack` ([A New Threat - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby)).
- `One moment everything was fine and the next thing we know gremlins are bursting out of the ground` ([Morlin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby)).
- `They burst out of the ground all around us...` ([The Collector - Camp Crimson - Nameless knight right of the Veteran Knight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector/Camp_Crimson)).

This, we believe, establishes a notion, - that of __gremlins' strategy of infiltrating enemy facilities by traversing Clockwork Tunnels below__. As the events of the attack on the Laboratory, Herex is familiar with such approach.

As Spiral Order hadn't discovered any sudden activity, it may be interpreted in 2 ways:

- The facility had already contained poison-themes constructs.
- While the facility was monitored, the infiltration had taken place with poison-themed constructs being remnants of the infiltration, being outsiders to the facility.

Given sudden decline in facility's activity, we can only image how it had happened only based on the events of [A New Threat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat) mission. [A New Threat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat) is the only direct instance of Herex's plan being witnessed prior to Swarm's explicit involvement - of an sudden assault performed through underlying Clockwork tunnels of Haven Lab.

If we attempt to extrapolate this strategy onto the complex, we can resolve the issue of a transportation of a squad of constructs into the facility under the logic of those belonging to Herex. But, compared to the New Threat, in Crimson Chaos we find constructs rather than living gremlins. And, small army of constructs is found in the Shadowplay's version of Firestorm Citadel, wherein those constructs had to be transported across the same route the knight would take, as more gremlin technology is found in the northern part of the Court.

So far it seems that constructs belong to Herex, based on other his appearances and themes.

###### Inner Fold of Compound 42

It is also here we may identify gremlins accompanying Herex in Shadowplay. Herex is seen to hide his true motivations: `All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Containment)).

Inner fold gremlins, given group's name, seem to be relatively trusted members close to Herex. Those would be likely loyal to Herex and his plans regarding Cradle and the Core. Given this reasoning, we propose, that are the [same gremlins found in the Throne Room of Shadowplay](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room).

###### Iron Assassins and Ghostmane Stalkers

The other instance of Herex's strategizing may be seen in the events of Operation Crimson Hammer, wherein Seerus explicitly suggests Spiral Order being under the command of Herex: `Who sent you infernal, iron assassins? Was it Herex? It matters not.` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Engines of War - Seerus]())

While Seerus also has under his command gremlin stalkers, the Knights being referred as assassins may hint at Ghostmane Stalkers being primary unit through which Herex executes his undercover operations.

More so, earlier mention of `Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Containment)) may also hint, that it is not him directly hunting for individuals which might have seemed so given his true opposition to Crimson Order, but rather those are Stalkers which operate on his behalf.

Presence of Ghostmane Stalkers in the complex seems us as further proof of those being Herex's primary force in undercover operations.

###### Development of Herex's Scheme

Given events of Operation Crimson Hammer, we may assume, that by the time of that mission Crimson Order or at least Seerus is already aware of Herex's plans as ones opposing Crimson Order, which is drastically opposite to initial preparation prior to retrieval of the Artifact in [The Ancient Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator): `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` ([Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Recon Module: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven)).

Entirety of Crimson Order facility - complex 357, - was slaughtered, seem to be a change Herex's strategy to more direct confrontation with Crimson Order, as also suggested by the recon module: `The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` ([Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Recon Module: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357)).

This narrative seem to also fit with Spiral Order, as it seem to arrive near earlier beginnings of Herex's execution of his plan. And, due to this parity, both Herex and Spiral Order in relation to Grand Arsenal from Seerus's perspective would seem to fit into the narrative of a direct armed confrontation.

###### Ownership and Contents of Complex 357

With aforementioned notions considered, we must analyze the state of the complex itself. The complex lacks any visual signs of being Crimson Order facility apart from a few monitors depicting its insignia. This is important in terms of consistency, as other signs affirming facility's ownership tend to exist.

We have previously seen Herex's compound 42 and Crimson Order hideout containing _Crimson Order insignia of green hue_, specifically, the [final arena of Containment of Compound 42](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment), and [Hidden Hideout of Spark and Roar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout). As such design pattern in absent in complex 357, we may assume that _complex 357 does not belong to Herex_.

Yet, this approach does not expand on presence of constructs:

- While mobile constructs - such as elite mecha-knights could be explained through the logic of them arriving from the tunnels, gun puppies are usually seen to emerge from the floors through hatches.
- Gun puppies are found at the main entrance road after the side bridge of the underground facility's elevator, and 2 more are found at respawn pads _behind the sandbag barricade guarding the gates of innermost facility_.

    During Shadowplay, [Sick Puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sick_Puppy#Sick_Puppy) are also present, which may hint at their mobility, but would not explain aforementioned placement as defensive one.

- There are 2 elite [poison knight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Poison_Knight#Poison_Knight) respawn pads by the sides of central battlepod in the final arena of the complex.

    We will return to this pattern in the context of Ironclaw Munitions factory, but here it is notable to establish a patten of a battlepod surrounded by respawn pads of elite constructs. By that we refer to [production center](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Production_Center) of [Toy Soldiers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers) mission. But, compared to production center, given a path to an elevator and potential location of schematics behind the battlepod, it is unlikely that it serves as a primary operational element of the facility, but rather its inner yard.

The central entrance of 9 tiles width to the first gatehouse surrounded by 2 armored watchtowers and accompanied by metal pillars on the sides, is severely damaged. The part of the bridge is blown off, and the part leading up the the gates has signs of bombardment or other force to be able to cause elongated gaps. This degree of damage could not be done by sole actions of Herex, if he was present, and Stalkers. But, it can be achieved, if we consider that both Mortafires and Demos are present during Shadowplay - as those are ones present in Deconstruction Zones, which, by design, are in a process of deconstruction. Considering the potential of [Mortafires' heavy infantry rockets](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mortafire) and [Demos' explosives](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Demo), this seems as a plausible explanation.

Throughout entirety of the facility there are many instances of fortifications from concrete blocks to barbed wire and anti-tank hedgehogs. Without demolishing those it'll be impossible to proceed deeper into the facility. Near the entrance to the courtyard, protected by 2 gates, several corpses are found.

Then, the facility is also filled with mineral rocks, which also hinder the movement deeper into the complex. Based on their different coloration, most distinctly seen on the eastern side of the complex, the _rocks are most likely made of the same minerals, as Moonstone, Dark Matter, Valestone, etc._ The Knight is required to clear those up in order to reach the end of the facility - we will keep this in mind.

###### Locations of The Schematics

Apart the above elements, there are several distinct rooms with more research-and-development-oriented design, with vials, clipboards and torn pages.

Those seem to us to be _the exact locations containing the schematics_:

- East of the front gates there is a room with a gold key, secured by 5 gates, activated by buttons, hidden among minerals. The room has a single [gun block](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Gun_Block.png) and a target, with 1 gremlin corpse and multiple torn pages on the floor, 2 clips, and multiple monitors depicting static.
- West of the front gates a room contains 2 cisterns, purple and green tubes of gel, monitors, a few smaller vials, 1 clip and a gremlin corpse with a few torn pages on the floor surrounding it.

    Notably, west of the entrance to the room a pool of gel and valestone is seen pumped out of a small pipe - [a specific design patten we will later identify as one of grinded minerals]().

    Norse of the most-west section with rocket blocks, a single tube of green liquid is located and few luminite minerals are found below it among a pair of 2 gears.
- The final room is located north of the complex, beyond the battlepod. There are also torn pages, several monitors, 2 clips, monitors with static, and, notably, several large books: as one is opened at the table, a tome, and what is supposedly a bookshelf, with a single gremlin corpse nearby.

Judging by that, it seems that the infiltration was sudden

Given all of those properties within the complex, from its gate icon to contents and context, we propose _Complex 357 being a multi-purposed research facility_ belonging to a different member of Crimson Order, which had utilized poison-themed constructs in its defenses.

But, we still do not know the contents of those schematics nor their purpose. We will return to those ones we cover the majority of the facilities on Cradle.

##### Cradle Defenses

Cradle weapons are encountered directly during intro cinematic, as were used on Skylark as well as potentially mentioned by Parma in the Refuge: `Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)).

Judging by the footage, the beams had originated from the exposed Clockworks' segments from 3 sources. The beams themselves are most reminiscent of lasers utilized by the battlepods of Grand Arsenal and Big Iron, as well as incorporated into Roarmulus Twins. A key difference here is the fact _those lasers are purple_. It can be explained by an application of shadow damage, which seems as both most plausible and single explanation.

Usage of shadow damage is not novel for gremlins, as they did utilize it, although in lesser amounts, _mostly attributed to the members of Crimson Order_, such as Seerus and his devices bombs - [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution) alchemy tree: `The perfected version of the shadowy bomb that Warmaster Seerus engineered with the sole purpose of eliminating other gremlins that stood in his way. It is thought to have been reserved for use against other members of the Crimson Order` ([Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution)). So the usage of it for the planetary defenses seems as likely explanation, considering that shadow damage is known to be dangerous both to gremlins and lichens.

##### The Collector

The Collector is described as follows: `There have been reports of a large, mechanical entity we have named the 'Collector' who has been intercepting our knights and taking both them and the sprites they were tracking and imprisoning them in a well-guarded compound deep within the Clockworks. Armed with your new sprite, your mission is to find this 'Collector' and rescue the knights and the sprites it has taken captive` ([The Collector](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector)).

Based on the analysis of Camp Crimson we came to conclusion, that the camp itself was established prior to arrival of Spiral Order, and, due to ability to capture Knights and Sprites by the Collector, we propose that its previous function was to capture gremlins at least.

Apart from this, it is likely that it had also served as an elite unit across constructs such as mecha knights by the fact of having similar design of wrenches in place of limbs and great offensive capabilities.

One of greater importance elements of its arsenal is the large charged explosion. This is the key element to a larger motif which will be then analyzed across gremlin technology. The explosion in both instances of the Collector - within the camp and at the [Overworks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/The_Overworks), - deals split shadow and normal damage, its only shadow damaging attack - _uncharacteristic of any other construct_. Moreover, the __explosion has an antique evil eye__ to appear, the same _observed across Electron and Graviton bombs design_. Considering this, a white painted evil eye of the same antique design with the Collector's eye meant to be an iris seems as an intentional design choice, which also points to its explosive shadow damage attack.

Apart from it, a different relation to curse arises here.

Lord Vanaduke, when he has no mask, has red and orange arcs of lightning around him. Those lightnings are the same as the collector. Moreover, Arkus also in his later stages of the fight has lightning arcs present in the same pattern, although of purple color, same as Darkfire Lord Vanaduke unmasked.

We suggest that this is a design pattern. If it would not be for the evil eye, this would not be a reason for an analysis of the latter. But, as the theme of curse in its different forms is consistent here, we propose that it serves as an argument for the _Collector being constructed utilizing far more advanced technology_, involving Underworld and application of shadow damage through the common pattern of an eye.

We were to develop this idea further, of Collector being an elite construct unit, application of shadow damage may be specifically devised to target other gremlins on a larger scale of entire battlefield, reminiscent of [Seerus's Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution). This does not exactly mean, that the Collector was designed by Seerus, as there are other 7 members of Crimson Order left unknown, but it is a pattern nonetheless.

The COllector possess a system on the back which seems to contain a storage of bombs. While this function does not reveal much, the symbol on the backpack tells much more - it is an inverted emblem found on the [ghost blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Block#Ghost_Block), which requires us to study the latter as we cover Clockworks themselves.

##### Electron Vortex

Electron vortex is an elemental counterpart of the Graviton bomb, but both have the same animation and presence of an antique evil eye of the same shape as the Collector. The case of the Collector - due to its explosion's design, we propose, is of the same nature as more likely electron bomb and less likely graviton bomb, yet, tapping into the powers of curse and Underworld.

But, due to descriptions of those bombs we believe they were invented in different period of time:

- `A small explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a vortex of crushing gravity` ([Graviton Charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Charge)).
- `A Graviton Bomb fortified with potentially dangerous amounts of shadow steel. Its blast should draw your foes toward it... if it doesn't rip the entire universe in two, that is` ([Graviton Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Vortex)).
- `A small electro-explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a crippling vortex of electricity` ([Electron Charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Charge)).
- `Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock` ([Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb)).
- `An Electron Bomb modified with a payload of unstable organic essence. Foes caught in its punishing radius are cruelly referred to as "thunderstuck"` ([Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex)). As it is stated to be `modified with a payload of unstable organic essence`, and by the fact of being a 5-star equipment, it has 1 additional material to its recipe - [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser): `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps`, which seems to us as direct confirmation of the elemental being used in the transmutation process.

We propose an explanation. That is gremlins have invented [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) based of the [Graviton Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb) through introduction of their own tech, specifically related to electricity and shock, likely through application of [Storm Chasers](), as it is present in the recipe.

We will see [later, that entirety of Clockworks at the end operates on instances of more arcane or magic properties of an established setting](), heavily leaning into magitech.

As it is an elemental counterpart to Graviton Bomb, the reason for devilish material - [Forbidden Fruit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Forbidden_Fruit) specifically, had to be justified, which here, we suggest, is a common underlying motif. It can be argued that [Forbidden Fruit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Forbidden_Fruit) is also used transmute [Twisted Spine Cone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Twisted_Spine_Cone), but we have to remember that Snarbolax, whom this item is attributed to, [is related to curse and then Underworld]().

##### Gremlin Incinerators

Multiple [Gremlins incinerators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Incinerator#Gremlin_Incinerator) are found in the end of compound 42 have a unique design. Not only they are as large as Razwog, their masks seem to suggest a similar inspiration. Those masks differ from regular wielding masks by the fact of being less of a visor and more of an eye. Notably, the plate the red eye is located on, also is capable of moving across the height of helm's surface as it has a slot underneath, similar to Collector's design.

Considering those scorchers are an elite units implied to be under a command of Herex of Crimson Order, we can make an educated guess that the _Collector's design in the context of gremlin elite units is more common than it seems._

##### Grand Arsenal

One of a few elements worth mentioning within the Grand Arsenal are the railways extending from the frontiers of of the complex. While no transportation carts were seen across the operation, we can suggest at least 2 uses for them:

- As there are several holding cells within the facility, it can be argued that those were transported across the rails, but, their number is minimal, compared to one of Camp Crimson.
- A more likely explanation is those railways are designed to deliver ammunition from the complex. Grand Arsenal is the only place apart from Razwog's facility above power complex, wherein [unused rockets are rotated enough](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Unused_Rocket.png) for gremlin insignia to be visibly seen, rather than its stripes.

Then there are what seems to be conveyors for missiles found below the Grand Arsenal artillery - 2 lines of missiles extending from the chambers protected with red force fields. Those 2 lines then, passing through a wall of the facility end with vertical launching systems, as evident by both the metal beams and how those rockets react to being damaged - by launching upwards. Since it is essentially a fortified arsenal storage facility, we can gather that it is not the production lines, but only of delivery and transportation.

##### Crimson Throne and Aftermath

The other point of interest is located at the end of Grand Arsenal, in the innermost location only labeled as "Aftermath" during the operation. It is accessed from behind the wall of the main entrance of the Arsenal, wherein the arsenal itself is found, with Crimson Order tapestry hanging above. This part of facility is the only one with visible walls extending above the ground level, resembling lobbies of danger missions.

The location of Aftermath seems to be the briefing room of the facility or its command center. We suspect such usage by 2 designs:

- As due to its unique execution with Crimson Order throne present at its center surrounded by hulls or built inactive Roarmulus Twins.
- Apart from the throne, there are 3 distinct areas.

    On sides of the throne 6 monitors are present, which seem to contain an important data, as it is encrypted. One of the soldiers accompanying Feron comments on the gremlin cryptography: `It'll take forever to decipher gremlin cryptography` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Aftermath - knight right of Feron]). We will revisit it later.

    The other area is located south of the throne, it is the one seen first, it also contains several non-interactive monitors.

By the sides of the throne room, there are 2 lines of storage, containing inactive and damaged Roarmulus Twins and battlepods. Weather those are manufactured within the facility is unknown, but, as suggested by existence of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, it seems that the latter is responsible for the production, while Arsenal is mostly utilized for storage.

##### Ironclaw Munitions Factory

Ironclaw Munitions Factory presents a few novel concepts, as well as reaffirms several previous ones.

First, we must establish the scope of the analysis. We consider regular shock-themed factory and its Shadow Lairs' fire-themed variant both as canon from the perspective of layout, design, and contents.

With this in mind we will go through both iteration of the factory, starting from the shock-themed variant.

The factory is described as follows:

- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory is a gremlin-operated weapons factory that specializes in the production of high-calibur explosives. Intel has revealed that it is developing a secret weapon known as 'Project Roarmulus' designed with the sole purpose of destroying Haven!` ([Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)).

    The `high-calibur` term here is likely a slightly modified caliber.

- `Once known to Spiral HQ as 'Project R', the Roarmulus Twins have been identified as a gremlin-engineered weapon of tremendous power built with the sole purpose of destroying Haven. Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, this weapon is not only protected by hordes of shock-powered constructs and gremlins, but the factory is a highly dangerous, explosive hazard itself!` ([Built to Destroy!](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Built_to_Destroy!)).

    While this themes of powerful weapons is present both for Roarmulus Twins and Sparkcaster, and as both are engineered under command of Seerus, this further establishes a concrete theme of wonder-weapons, around which Seerus as a member of Crimson Order revolves.
- `After analyzing the schematics you recovered from the gremlin test lab, Spiral HQ know knows the nature of Project R as well as its location within a gremlin munitions facility. Spiral HQ is requesting that you enter this facility and destroy Project R before it can be used on Haven. Speak with Intel Agent Kora for full details` ([Target Acquired](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)).
- `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' ... Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade! ... Based on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the strangers should it reach the Arcade. ... We have pinpointed its location to be in the deepest level of a gremlin facility known as the 'Ironclaw Munitions Factory.' The factory is used for the production of all manners of gremlin weaponry and is highly dangerous, even to the gremlins working there. ... There's one last thing- it seems you won't be the first knight to have entered the Ironclaw Munitions Factory. We've detected another Alpha Squad recon module somewhere within the factory` ([Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)).

Based on the [earlier analysis of Big Iron battlepod lasers]() we had proposed that the factory itself is at least hundred years old due to presence of laser technology. It is most visible as being tested at the end of [Warfare Workshop](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/Warfare_Workshop), as testing targets are placed against the canons.

###### Entrance and Abandoned Assembly

The deteriorated state of the [abandoned assembly](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Abandoned_Assembly) as its name suggest an event or a series of events which had led up to structural damage and abandonment while the facility itself had remained operational, evident by the ongoing production of weapons - being the Roarmulus Twins' components, - and later change from electric weaponry to fire-focused ones.

We can also draw parallels with the state complex 357 is found in, due to both having the same gate icon of the production facility and seemingly abandoned state.

In this context, while Herex, we believe, is not involved with the state of munitions factory, it suggests a _strategic value of complex 357_, implied by the importance of the schematics' retrieval.

Entrance to the factory, same as complex 357, is also particularly distinct. The entrance has an 11 tile width road, with an entrance of 4 tiles with distinct walls, reminiscent of the Royal Jelly Palace, Firestorm Citadel, or Grand Arsenal.

On the side of the main entrance road there are 6 structure support beams with the foundations of Clockworks' design. Several roads, leading up to the entrance, apart from the upper depth elevator, are blown off, with significant structural damage to the road itself.

This design reminds us of Herex's hideout, and its above-ground structure, traversed in the [Bitter Battle](), where in the leftmost road around a hull of the facility is broken.

Once inside the walls, the factory separates into 2 wings, both of which contain several instances of Project R components, all of which were depicted on the [Roarmulus Blueprints](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Roarmulus_Blueprints). Apart from it several deign choices are found in the eastern wing which seem to suggest those being conveyor belts.

###### Warfare Workshop

Within the Warfare Workshop another feature of the factory becomes more consistent, which was also present on previous depth - pools of [quicksilver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Quicksilver) slime. Those are reminiscent of previously discussed compound 42's likely artificially created [toxoils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Toxoil). We will [return to the nature of Quicksilvers]() in the [analysis of the Jelly Kingdom]().

As for Workshop's layout, it has a central hall, separated from the machinery on the sides separated with walls, and during infiltration it is notable that western wing was not visited, although the path their remains intact.

It is the left wing which allows to understand approximate size of the facility, with the same design of 3 spaciously places support pillars as those found near the entrance hall of the facility, and eastern wall being a support or scaffolding structure.

It is also in the western wing an internal components of the Roarmulus twin are seen. In the end of the facility's floor and to the west testing grounds for laser cannons are present.

###### Bottom of the Factory

In the final depth of the facility, which is also described as its deepest point (`Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory` - [Built to Destroy!](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Built_to_Destroy!), `We have pinpointed its location to be in the deepest level of a gremlin facility known as the 'Ironclaw Munitions Factory'` - [Target Acquired - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired)) the same large structure beams are consistently placed in relatively large amount, as in previously discussed Herex's [hideout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout). We believe, those serve the same purpose, as they are present in the deepest points of both locations, they also mark it as, seemingly most secure, as conveyed by the design choice of those beams being placed in the first place.

If the entire plot of Project R is taken in consideration with the context of the factory being at that level of maintenance, we can make a guess that _the gremlin society is long past its prime._

Lastly, the end of the floor with inactive models of Roarmulus Twins contains _Crimson Order Terminal_:

- `The Nine see all, hear all. Obey the iron Law` ([Built to Destroy! - The Roarmulus Twins - Crimson Order Terminal](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/The_Roarmulus_Twins)).
- `Crimson Order Directives: It is the DUTY of every gremlin to repel the metal intruders! Every Gremlin must work to destroy Haven. Cradle belongs to us! Every Gremlin must remain LOYAL to King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order. The Iron Law must be obeyed!` ([Built to Destroy! - The Roarmulus Twins - Crimson Order Terminal: Crimson Order Directives](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/The_Roarmulus_Twins)).
- `Transmission: 'They continue to advance and thwart our schemes! How could they have discovered Project R? Why was there no advance warning of the attack?'; - 'Herex and his minions were supposed to be spying on them but they have vanished like cowards.'; - 'To defy Iron Law is to defy the Order! Track the traitor down. Herex will answer for this setback.'` ([Built to Destroy! - The Roarmulus Twins - Crimson Order Terminal: Crimson Order Transmission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/The_Roarmulus_Twins)).

As previously discussed in the analysis of Iron Law, we have suggest that Herex was marked as a traitor due to his inactivity towards his duty of spying on Spiral Order and his disappearance. But now we are concerned with the actual speakers. As the transition suggests, there are 3 quotes, which may be members of Crimson Order. The reference towards Isorans as metal intruders, as noted earlier, is reminiscent to Seerus's manner of speaking. Given his involvement with the Project R, we are leaning to an ide of at least one of those speakers to be Seerus.

As for the other quotes, the third is of greater importance, as it strongly suggests, that members of Crimson Order themselves are not protected from being marked as traitors. The down-talking manner of the third quote is interesting as it may be either:

- A different member of Crimson Order speaking;
- King Tinkinzar, due to his higher position.

But, as very little information is provided regarding the identity or even existence of the king, we have to keep this notion in mind. The first quote of `Why was there no advance warning of the attack?` might suggest that the attack in question is of the knight entering the factory, which can only mean that the dialogue between those Crimson Order members had to happen very recently.

#### Gremlin Weapons' Magic Motifs

Now, there are not many elemental gremlin weapons in a sense closer to Owlites, as they had directly utilized elemental materials, relating back to the discussion of Owlite academy and Valkyrian armors. This is a prelude to an analysis of underlying magitech themes of Clockworks and gremlin technology, and here we would like to look at the final designs and draw parallels to other similar instances.

Considering 2 following aspects:

- Shadow Ironclaw Munitions Factory only recently into the supposed timeline has started to produce fire-themed weapons, finalizing in, by far, more hazardous designs of Red Roarmulus Twins.

    With this, we observe in Red Roarmulus Twins a design, __uncharacteristic of any gremlin technology__, even other fire-themed ones. In relation to this _Vog-like design of Red Roarmulus Twins_ only tier 3 elemental gun puppies reach, but they are predominantly stone-like in texture and carvings, when compared to their normal-damage counterparts.

- Shadow weapons, on the other hand, are kept to upper classes of gremlin hierarchy - such as Dark Retribution, and, supposedly, planetary lasers.

    Yet, those devices are seem to be more consistent in their design. Presence of shadow elements and Underworld's symbology while is subtle, is consistent with the rest of gremlin technology. Consider here instances as such as the Collector and Incinerators.

We can make an educated guess that Cradle's defenses did consist of the same laser technology found in the factory, but, due to subtle coloring, also possess shadow-damage.

It is through the analysis of the events preceding the infiltration of the factory by Spiral Order in ["Built to Destroy" mission]() we can discover the scope of gremlin technology and advancements, which we see as thematically consistent with the earlier case of laser technology, acknowledging multitude of other motifs and preestablished principles across Cradle.

- `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by. If this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components. Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis. It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R` ([Plan of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack)).

    Power grid is hidden within the toxic cavern and contains a hull of an inactive Roarmulus Twin. The power complex itself, in its purpose is reminiscent of Razwog's facility, as in both cases the centerpoint is the power cords leading up to the mission's key element, either being the generator, or the first introduction of Roarmulus Twins' design.

    The other element, which we have [discussed in relation to Maskeraith](), is the pattern of secret facilities being located in the caverns.

- `Intel had reported a gremlin deconstruction crew dismantling a portion of the Clockworks in order to generate scrap resources for use in their Project R. Using powerful welding torches, they are truly burning the place to the ground. One of the squads investigating the site has gone missing and is believed to be now held in captivity at the site. Infiltrate the fiery deconstruction zone and rescue the captive knights. But be warned, the deconstruction crew are said to have a powerful security construct hidden somewhere on site` ([High Temperature Hostages](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/High_Temperature_Hostages)).

    Rhe description suggests, based both on the rank missions' activity and tone of other descriptions, that the process of Roarmulus Twins' construction is done with a high pace and alarming priority.

    It is also here [oilers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Oiler) are found, with a visible presence of abundant slime, seen previously in the context of Herex's compound 42.

- `A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley'. These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seems to be determined to completely wipe out. Spiral HQ believes that gremlins are using the lumber from this operation as resources for the development of Project R and needs you to enter the Jigsaw Valley and shut it down` ([Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil)).

It is here we should delve into the final assessment of the species of trees and plants found across Clockworks, mentioned in the quote: `These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees ...` ([Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil)).

#### Ironwood, Wyrmwood, and Twisting Trees

Here we build upon the [previous introduction of ironwood and other types of wood](), as ones with fictional properties. It is within the context of Roarmulus Twins Ironwood and other types of trees are worth noting outside of the analysis of alchemy of ironmight equipment, specifically due to the context of [Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil) mission: `A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley'. These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seems to be determined to completely wipe out`.

As gremlins were harvesting trees of [Aurora Isles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles), Spiral Order has described those trees as `even stranger species of twisting trees` ([Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil)), which allows us to suggest that those tree are not a familiar species of plants to Isorans.

Then, at the end of the mission knight is rewarded with the [Redwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood_Bracelet). This seems as a direct connection between the type of wood of those twisting trees and the bracelet, both being made of redwood.

If we extrapolate this idea onto other types of wood, we can make a solid connection, that all of those twisting trees correspond to types of wood found across Clockworks through existence of other types of bracelets: [Driftwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood_Bracelet) and [Ironwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Bracelet). These items, we believe, _imply that the trees of those species were present during existence of the Ironmight kingdom_, linking back to te idea of _most of regions within Clockworks coming from a harvested precursor planet_.

Then there is the [Wyrmwood bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyrmwood_Bracelet). All of bracelets made of wood grant resistance to shock, and they have a parity to according materials based on naming convention, color, and star rarity. Among them, Wyrmwood bracelet is the only 5-star trinket, and there is no 5-star variant of wood, as ironwood is the last material in this roster, being a material of 4-star rarity rating. We suggest, that there is a type of wood which is called wyrmwood, in its properties surpassing [ironwood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood): `A pristine log of one of the hardest substances known to the Spiral Knights`.

We can also figure out what wyrmwood looks like based on other bracelets:

- [Driftwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood_Bracelet) has pale brown color scheme, as driftwood inventory icon. Driftwood bracelet it is acquired for 5 forge sparks.
- [Redwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood_Bracelet) has bright red color scheme, while redwood inventory icon has pale red or pink color. redwood bracelet is acquired for 20 forge sparks.
- [Ironwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Bracelet) same as ironwood inventory icon has metallic grey color scheme. Ironwood bracelet is acquired for 50 forge sparks.
- [Wyrmwood Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyrmwood_Bracelet) is bright green and is acquired for 100 forge sparks.

Wyrmwood is not usually referred as a species of wood, contrary to the term of ironwood, but its name can be translated to wormwood, reminiscent of both dragons, and their relatives - wyrns, - when existence of wyverns was suggested, and of celestial themes.

The celestial theme, mentioned in passing seems us to be applicable both through the morphology of the word, and, coincidentally, a name of a _star_, mentioned in the Book of Revelations:

<BookCitation source="Revelation 8:1-11">

Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.

The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.

The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water — the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.

</BookCitation>

Considering a more fantastic setting we are working with and more direct inspiration and naming parity, here we suggest, a parallel can be drawn between wyrmwood, wyverns, celestial ore, and sun silver, going beyond regular interpretation of wormwood. But, it is a wood nonetheless, evident by a bracelet of amplified, compared to ironwood, properties.

One particular inspiration we suggest taking place here. Ironwood is a forest in norse mythology, inhabited by jotun. Then we had a single instance of [Ironwood Sentinel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Sentinel#Ironwood_Sentinel), which is a weaponized [lumber](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Sentinel#Lumber) with an axe. There are [Void Lumbers, which behave as lumbers, but possess an axe](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Sentinel#Void_Lumber).

We have previously suggested that in the context of norse mythology, valkyries of heavenly kingdom could have interacted with tortomega. Then gremlins would harvest the materials from the floating isles, which we have established to belong to tortomega based on its' ruins designs and gun puppy statues. Tortomega, as constructs, drop sun silver, which we have proposed being refined celestial ore, relation to heavens due to its description. Then, as between tortomega civilization and gremlins there was a period of time, attributed to Almire, Ironmight Kingdom was proposed to inhabit this area.

So, could it be that wyrmwood is an instance of the heavenly wood? We believe, considering its presence, it could. The fact that this wood grants most protection of shock status, seem to suggest its origins connected to sky, reminding of owlites' developments against effects of shock and fire. Here a connection to heavens also could be established though the presence of wyverns, potential descendants of dragons, which we have concluded being a unique specie.

Lastly, as we have introduced this idea in the end of chapter 7 and 8, Valkyries are guards of heavenly kingdom, and the Sleeper is the closest to a god-like entity, devoid of protection by the time Spiral Order had arrived - due to those motif, we had proposed, that Sleeper was protected by valkyries of heavenly kingdom, referred in case of Armor of the fallen, as the paradise (`A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` - [Armor of the Fallen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen)). The paradise, as a term in its literal interpretation - one most probable, given adjacent motifs, assumes a divine presence, to which Sleeper seems us to fit particularly well. __This proposal, through this logic, explain a theme of protection for Sleeper before Gremlins.__

As for the Roarmulus Twins, we suggest that at least ironwood was harvested to construct their armor, as an accent is made on it: `These giant gun puppies showcase impenetrable armor and high powered munitions. Their skin is so thick they are only vulnerable to fraternal firepower` ([Monstrous Codex: Roarmulus_Twin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Roarmulus_Twin)). It is unknown, weather wyrmwood was intended to be used in the construction of the Twins.

#### Gun Puppies: From Dragons to Red Roarmulus Twins

We have proposed, the tier 1 gun puppies were made of stone, designed and created by descendants of dragons - tortomega, to imitate dragons. Howlitzers became undead drakes. While we have covered tier 1 designs, tier 2 and 3 were not. So far we have only drawn parallels between extreme design of Red Roarmulus Twins to elemental tier 3 gun puppies.

The tier 1 origin's idea was based on the design of tier 1 gun puppies, specifically, their outer shells being made of stone, as well as lacking more complex metal designs of the rest of gremlin constructs, apart from lumbers. We keep in mind, that tier 1 gun puppies were seen with a revealed hull, containing mechanical internals. This structure is reminiscent of tortodrones, whose externals are made of stone, while those are identified as constructs.

As with the topic of the collector, elemental gremlin technology is also present for gun puppies and rocket puppies. Specifically in the form of elemental variants. By that we mean only tier 1 gun puppies were invented by tortomega, as only they possess consistent stone-like design, without any complex forms or separate jaw, as tier 2 and above, and elemental variants.

It can be argued that rocket puppy is on the same primitive design, but it would seem anachronistic fot tortomega utilize metal-made rockets, as we have seen them use depleted mineral shards in no-less effective manner. But, even this argument considered, tortodrones can be brought up, as they are the most effective demonstration of military abilities of tortomega civilization, albeit focused on minerals and stone. Considering it, we lean to tier 1 rocket puppies being invented later by gremlins.

Elemental gun puppies, on the other hand, do not have bolted foundation and generally look more arcane or fantasy-like - with glowing spirals incorporated in their designs. But here we should note a common element found across manufactured equipment - the 3-dot triangular shape present, which is seen on high-tech [equipment](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/9/9e/Radiant_Pulsar-Equipped.png) and [devices](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/f/f4/Monster-Slush_Puppy_3.png), reminding of tactical markings.

##### Red Roarmulus Twins

Apart from those design, we should look at both Roarmulus Twins and Red Roarmulus twins in most proper manner.

In this context, we reiterate on the specificity of their design, as far more hazardous, as they seem structurally unstable, as well as lacking any gremlin writings present on regular Roarmulus Twins.

The description of the Shadow Ironclaw Munition Factory with the design of its enemies seem to suggest, that it is not an uncommon design choice, but rather extrapolated onto larger constructs, reminiscent of more deteriorated state of corrupted tortodrones and elemental gun puppies, _as if the introduction of elemental powers closer to magic amplifies some aspects of the construction and reduces others._

And it is through gun puppies we can observe an extent to which gremlin technology utilizes elemental properties, which will be important [in relation to the magitech of Clockworks proper]().

Fiery variant of gun puppies - [Red Rovers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies#Red_Rover) and [regular Gun Puppies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies#Gun_Puppy) are in a unique position as they have boss variants, Roarmulus Twins. While gun puppies might not be of such great interest for us, apart from mentioned gremlin writings on the armor plates, the Red Roarmulus Twins are. In fact, those writings can be distinguished only through direct view of the Red Roarmulus Twins' texture, which does seem as they are not intended to be seen.

Red Rovers have an attack same as Lord Vanaduke in his last phase, _which demonstrates the extent of powers of the cursed entities_. But, at that, only tier 3 red rovers are seen to be explicitly burning, with visible glow between the joints of the armor plates, as well as glowing spiral slab on top.

Red Roarmulus twins have only external layer of armor plates damaged by fire, while the internal components are seemingly red-hot, similar to red rovers. At that, the construction of lasers is also unique, as they are red, which are encountered only one more time - in Warmaster Seerus's chamber during the events of Operation Crimson Hammer.

The very existence of far more hazardous construction of the facility, as well as the state of Red Roarmulus Twins, we believe, demonstrates the extent at which elemental properties can be integrated in gremlin technology, albeit with a greater risks of the resulting constructing seeming more unstable, that is judging by Red Roarmulus Twins' and elemental gun puppies' designs.

#### Jelly Kingdom and Slimes

For the first time lichens and the existence of slime family of monsters was introduced in [Alien Ooze mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze), where Spiral Order has concluded, that lichens had arrived on a meteor: `Lichens are an alien species of the slime family thought to have come to the Clockworks via a meteor that crashed on to the surface of Cradle` ([Alien Ooze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze)).

There are 2 distinct categories of slimes in the slime family: lichens, which make up lichen colonies, and jellies, which comprise the majority of the Jelly Kingdom.

The main factor contributing to such classification is the physiology of both lifeforms, characterized by, generally, their viscosity and stability of form. We propose, that jellies are the descendant, or rather, matured lichens with a more complex, established hierarchy, - the jelly kingdom itself as an organized social structure. A following comparison of those species outlines their similarities and distinct features, which had led us to this proposal.

Both species have a distinct core. There are instances of multiple cores, making up sentient colonies (`Lichens are an alien species of the slime family ... formed from innumerable smaller slimes that form mobile, sentient 'colonies.'` - [Alien Ooze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze)), as well as large royal jellies.

A notion could be established here, that of both sentient lichen colonies of multiple cores and larger jellies with multiple cores function identically, _as a single, unified organisms_, capable of higher mental functions, as evident by existence of a monarchy of royal jellies - who, as far as presence of Ice Queen and Royal Jelly suggests, require at least 3 cores to function.

We derive this number from an amount of cores observed within the Ice Queen - 2 small cores rotating a larger one. We have not yet seen other instances of such pattern of rotation, as, usually, the cores rotate as a uniform structure within a volume of a body - he most prominent case being Jelly King.

That is, if we interpret the understanding of monarchy as universally common concept. And given general setting and presence of royal attributes, we can conclude that is indeed the commonly understood perception of monarchy.

This monarchy is embodied by [Jelly King's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_King) and [Ice Queen's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen) [crowns](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Crowns) having many of _common design elements of a european Imperial Crown_.

- `monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes` ([Another Trace - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace)).
- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and its king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!` ([Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)).
- `A regal crown resembling that ever-frigid Ice Queen. In addition to providing great defense, it is said to dramatically boost one's ego and create a cold detachment from those around them` ([Ice Queen Crown](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown)).

##### Brutes

We known that those core-like objects are called cores based on the line of slime core items - `A fist-sized, gelatinous lump collected from a jelly` ([Gel Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gel_Core)). Gel Core is used in alchemy of [Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Helm): `Gelatinous headgear made from gooey guardians`. We can guess that those jellies' role is likely of guards, as it is those who guard entrance to the [Garden of Goo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Garden_of_Goo) behind [palace's walls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace). This pattern of explicitly distinct walls going to the sides of the main entrance as it was seen, is common among other fortifications, attributed to a few other civilizations found on Cradle - a motif of castles, first, albeit in a different context, pointed out in the [analysis of mysterious consoles' placements](), and then of the Great Citadel of Almire.

It is here we are presented with a hierarchy, characterized by coupling of rarity identified by Spiral Order, and families of slimes - of brutes, rock jellies, and nobles. Given prior identification of 2-star Gel Core as _a guardians'_ (`Gelatinous headgear made from gooey guardians` - [Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Helm)), we can outline a vague roles of the other names, starting from brutes.

The [Brute Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core): `An oozing blue lump from a particularly potent gelatinous opponent` is utilized for it set of 3-star slime-themed gear:

- `A hardy helm crafted from overly oppressive ooze` ([Brute Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Helm)).
- `A firm set of mucilaginous mail crafted from the remains of particularly antagonistic jellies` ([Brute Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Mail)).
- 3-star [Brute Jelly Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Band) trinket is also found here.

A brute, considering medieval themes of jelly kingdom and throne, considering specifics of hierarchy of brutes, rocks and royals, we may suggest the prior being a unit of castle's of kingdom's army.

There are a few other 3-star jelly cores:

- `A solid, pulsating lump that oozes with vitriol` ([Toxic Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxic_Core)).
- `A pungent mass pulled from a slimy assailant. Its aroma is an excellent remedy for insomnia, as well as nighttime sniffling and sneezing` ([Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core)).

Those subspecies of slimes does not seem t belong to an aforementioned hierarchy, but rather a more primordial organization of lichens, where the cores are found, most prominently seen in [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core), due to a smaller scope of presence of sleep status effect.

##### Rock Slimes

The [Rocky Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rocky_Core): `A delicious gummy treat with an impenetrable rocky shell. More than a few teeth have been lost by knights attempting to get at the gooey interior`, bears themes of sturdiness of rock, also present in the transmuted 4-star equipment:

- `A tough topper tailored from jagged jelly` ([Rock Jelly Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Helm)).
- `Crafted from the most adamant of slimy specimens, it also functions as an emergency source of calories for stranded knights` ([Rock Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield)).
- `This gelatinous gear combines the sturdiness of stone with the piercing protection of sticky goo. its a wonder that you managed to beat up the jelly this is made out of` ([Rock Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Mail)).
- A 4-star [Rock Jelly](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Band) trinket is found here.

We can suggest those being the heavy infantry of the kingdom, as well as them being the closest to royalty, as they have 4-star rarity.

##### Royalty and Nobles

The [Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core): `A sweet-smelling lump of ooze collected from a particularly noble specimen of slime` specifies the role and position of those slimes. Royal Core is utilized in most of 5-star slime-themed equipment, such as [Royal Jelly Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Mail): `A viciously viscous set of armor crafted painstakingly from the most noble specimens of quivering slime`. This notion is also observed in the trinket of [Royal Jelly Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Band).

##### Properties of Slime

These cores demonstrate color variation in types of jellies, but also their properties and taste. The latter is specified by the alchemy tree of jelly shields:

- `it also functions as an emergency source of calories for stranded knights` ([Rock Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield)).
- `it is durable, light, and delightfully berry-flavored` ([Brute Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Shield)).

This attribute, with consideration of danger is slime (`Please note that members of the slime monster family (jellies, lichens, polyps, glop drops, Royal Jelly, Ice Queen) are not edible and should not be ingested under any circumstance, despite the fact that some may resemble a confection` - [Regarding Slimes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352)), can be explained through a property of not lichens, but of tropical frogs due to the contrast color being a sign of toxicity, as a lead.

It is known that at least lichens arrived on a meteor, and, due to anatomical and biological similarity of jellies and lichens, we consider both being alien to Cradle. Apart from it, jellies, and specifically royal slimes, have visible core as large lichen colonies.

The [Daybreaker Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Daybreaker_Band) line of trinkets specifies as being: `A curious circle coated with calcified slime`. This is important, as proposes a property of slime to calcify - which, in fact, is seen both in Polyps and in larger lichen colonies - _as the spikes they possess are most reminiscent of calcified slime_.

It is also important to mention a color shift of lichen colonies as they grow larger. Lichen colonies as well as jellies both are also capable of extending their spikes through the ground - this trait is particularly unique in general context to connect both species to a common ancestor, which, as we have suggested, are lichens, specifically yellow lichens.

Under this logic it is the left ambiguous, how creatures like blast cubes, toxigels, slooms, and by proxy void gels came to existence, as they look and act practically same as lichens, yet have a single larger core. We will keep them in mind until later discussion.

###### Themes of Sleep, Solstice and Alchemy

The [Somnambulist's  Totem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Somnambulist%27s_Totem) is described as `An ordinary object with a unique texture and weight, the result of having been partially digested by a Sloombargo`, also suggests an existence of residue left by slimes. In both cases - of Daybreaker band and Somnambulist totem there is a distinct accent on a _transitory time_, a _transition from night to day_, a change. This is seen in the alchemy line of Daybreaker Band.

The somnambulist's Totem has similar theme, as it bridges the gap between day and night through a phenomenon somnambulistic walk, or, dream-like. If we develop this ide further - a somnambulist, metaphorically, would be anyone traversing the Starlight Cradle, marking it to a dream. That is not to say that Starlight Cradle does not physically exist, rather that the totality of its properties frames it as dream-like. We will keep this theme of dreams in mind.

There is also the https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Solstice_Ring which in its recipe combines concepts of say and night, represented by:

- `An enchanted ring that embodies the spirit of the solstice. Its sparkling silver luster shines brightest during the winter months` https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silver_Solstice_Ring
- `An enchanted ring that embodies the spirit of the solstice. Its glittering golden luster shines brightest during the summer months` https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Solstice_Ring

And we we are to apply alchemical motifs - the fact that Grand Solstice ring is a combination of opposites, which embodies characteristics of both while being greater - as `Grand` - than its components individually, seems to be one of more distilled metaphors for an alchemical motif.

More so, the color scheme of Grand Solstice Ring is of _red and white - which are absent in the Silver and Gold bands_. While silver is attributed to the Moon or night, and gold is attributed to Sun and day, red and white together are explained by an alchemical symbolism - of an alchemical marriage of a metaphorical Red King and White Queen, which themselves embody and encompass characteristics of Sun and Moon.

While not directly related to alchemy, an idea of transition from night to day, an idea of somnambulism, existence of Starlight Cradle itself, - all are found in relation to slime family of monsters on Cradle - is a pattern nonetheless.

As there is a distinction between lichens and slimes, we propose, that the aforementioned theme of night passing into day amongst lichens is _a metaphor for emergence of consciousness_ - __a jelly kingdom__, - a complex hierarchy of individual consciousnesses arriving from a hivemind of primordial lichen colonies, bridged by a concept of multiple slime cores and a greater complexity.

Under this interpretation, Starlight Cradle becomes even more so important to the development of jelly kingdom, as its naming and themes may be interpreted under a few new perspectives, and that is while the location itself is mostly disconnected from the rest of Cradle, apart from containing the same common strata of ruins.

##### Glop family of Slimes

On the other hand, there are minis, [shankles](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shankle), and [glop drops](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glop_Drop), which lack a distinct core:

- Minis originate from polyps, as implied by the throne room of the Royal Jelly Palace.
- Drops are widespread in compounds and treasure vaults, which contains a third species of slimes - shankles. Yet, based on the tier 3 designs, there is a possibility of them possessing a core, which can be reshaped, or at least, an inner glow, which is more probable as no other slime species were capable of drastic changes of their shape.
- Shankles are only species which have a distinct biological features, such as an eye, eyes, or a mouth.

Considering the behavior of mimics, we can suggest those to inhabit the outskirts of gremlin settlements and facilities. But, they do have an implication of an existing hierarchy, as [Treasure Mimic's](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Treasure_Mimic) tendrils have a crown of an imperial design. Through the presence of tendrils and their behavior -- as ones emerging from the ground, -- we can confirm, that shankles are sub-species of slimes.

#### Gremlin Bioengineering

Across the suggested physiology of slimes, existence of [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Toxigel), [toxoils](), and [quicksilvers]() subspecies seem to become more so nuanced.

We propose, that during observed events both gremlins and Spiral Order had gained understanding of slimes' physiology, which had allowed for both to develop their own technologies.

It is important to establish, which slimes we consider artificial, as well as describe the reasoning behind this selection.

##### Blast Cubes

Under current proposal, we suggest, that [Blast Cubes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly#Blast_Cube) are artificial slimes, created by gremlins. We propose such origin due to Cubes' unique and unstable property to explode - this characteristic is not observed anywhere else, nor in any slime family. Yet, [Blast Cubes](), [explosive blocks](), and _Collector's bombs_ seem to have a _common nature or physical resemblance_, which could be a budget restriction, or an intentional design choice guided by gremlin technological advancements. Yet, while there is existence of an explored and an established link between compound 42 and toxic gels, there is no such link for blast cubes. This is what we will attempt to establish.

Blast Cubes have a peculiar variation in color, transitioning from _yellow, to _reddish crimson_, and finally to _purple_ depending on Clockworks depth or tier.

Visibly cracked blackened edges on all variants of the Cubes give impression of cooler areas on top of heated surface, _reminiscent of molten metal dross_. This theme of heat links those to Vog's curse within Firestorm Citadel, and to industrial motif of molten slag as an unstable result of heavy industry. The latter reminds us of [Blast Furnaces across Clockworks](), which, given their name, seem to fit well with abn established industrial theming.

In the latter two variants blast cubes possess _lightning arcs_ around the core within the main body of slime, an established so far element of an energy excess.

When Blast Cubes are damaged enough, stability of they body seem to falter similar to larger jellies, - Jelly Kings' and Ice Queen's deaths, - as more lightnings emerge from the core and confinement of main body of slime across all explosive variants. In the very final moment the core explodes, suggesting that it being the energy source for the slime, apart from its nerve center. _This distinction in self-destructing purpose seems too rare to be an evolutionary trait_.

##### Presence of Explosive Blocks and Gun Blocks for Owlites

As Blast Cubes function very similar to Explosive Blocks, we have to look at those within the context of they placement across the volume of Cradle and Clockworks.

They are present in the Scarlet Fortress, as much as respawn pads.

At the _Rampants_ Lockdown map, being the Scarlet Fortress, there are even gremlin [rocket blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Rocket_Block.png) on the east side of the castle, showing a pattern resembling early bastions. As rocket clocks are usually associated with gremlins, their presence coupled with Rampants being connected to Lockdown map lobbies, suggests 2 explanations: of those being placed in the far past, or, those are built later by those who organize the Lockdown. As the prior is more complex, one suggestion, coupled with presence of gun puppies, may be of those being rudimentary cannons, given less grounded themes of Owlites.

Weather this can be said of explosive blocks, we could not say with full certainty. The same can be attributed to higher tier gun puppies, such as those present in [Firestorm Citadel's Charred Court](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court). As far as we are aware of gremlin technology, and as we mentioned it previously - a formidable chance of gremlins attempting to contain Firestorm Citadel exists, mainly due to [presence of elevators]().

With this, we are leaning to the idea of _explosive blocks' origins being rooted in Gremlin research_, while origin of _Blast Cubes_, given their more recent arrival as slimes, seems to be _that of artificial creation_.

More so, the design of explosive blocks become more so important, as __it is a pulsing sphere, similar to explosive sphere within the Core__, and also reminiscent of one within collapsed grim gate's portal, both contained in translucent cubes.

This design seems intentional, _as if the technology from the Core would be subtly applied across the Clocwkorks_.

We will keep this peculiarity in mind once we get to the analysis of the Core proper, and [the other block, which case its instance within the Core]().

##### Toxigels, Oilers, Toxoils

Encountered [Toxins]() and [Oilers]() are placed together mainly due to [the contents and context of compound 42]().

Based on the memos in the facility: `it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` ([Compound 42 - Containment - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment)), - it seems that the biological weapon in question was not intended to become such as it is seem by the time the facility is being burned to the ground. But, a plausible explanation can be presented, that those weapon were derived of slimes.

Event of the Vile Engine seem to suggest that the slime generator, while in-game were seen to produce quicksilver lichens, are in fact capable of both, judging by the outer regions of generators' influence, resulting in creation of the Rotting Metropolis: `It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them. A modern city, much like those that the devilites inhabit seems to be overrun with these toxins, and was probably left behind by both the devilites and gremlins as a result. Now a legion of slime and undead creatures haunt the place, festering in the poisons that linger in the air` ([The Rotting Metropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Rotting_Metropolis)).

As for the [oilers](), tubes of dark liquid, oil, are found in the end of compound 42 and cisterns in the final arena of [Terminal Meltdown, Fuel Depot Entrance](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Terminal_Meltdown_Fuel_Depot_Entrance.png). Those seem as evidence of oilers' artificial nature.

And lastly, the fact [toxigels]() and oilers were mixed to create [toxoils](), unique subspecies to compound 42, suggests in most direct manner capacity of _gremlin researchers to create or derive engineered subspecies of slimes_.

Notably, when oiler is ignited, its core also burns, making it visible only in such state. This industrial motif is also present for quicksilver lichens.

##### Quicksilver Lichens and Mercury

As [toxoils were purposed to become bioweapons](), as [blast cubes were devised as mobile bombs](), as [oiler were used in the heating and smelting facilities](), _quicksilvers_, we believe, are utilized as _mobile batteries_.

The first element is lichens' name, - quicksilver, - is an archaic term for mercury. The design of lichens suggest it being true, as quicksilver has same reflective properties, attributed to mercury.

While a connection between mercury and self healing of those lichens may not relate to anything in particular, it is important to look at other aspect of their design and themes, present across Spiral Order equipment - [quicksilver armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail) alchemy tree, including [Mercurial Demo set](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit).

The persisting theme is one of electricity:

- `A fine set of mail made of what was once a Quicksilver` ([Quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail)). Despite referring to mercury in the past tense, the mail remain with this name. Quicksilver in this context might mean the lichen, as alchemy of the next in line upgrade - [Charged quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Mail) contains all of the familiar slime-related materials, such as gel cores, [Brute Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core), [Gel Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gel_Core), and [Volt Oil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volt_Oil).
- [Charged Quicksilver Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Mail) is a direct upgrade of the prior with instruction of [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball) into its alchemy.

    The description of [its charged helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Helm): `An enhanced Quicksilver Helm conductive to the destruction of electrical foes`, - might suggest that it is a state of armor, or rather, mercury/quicksilver itself, within which charged quicksilver lichens are encountered.

- The final upgrade, [Mercurial Mail](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Mail): `A supreme set of silver armor that'll put a spring in your step while keeping shocks out of it`, and [Mercurial Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Helm) - `A sublime silver helmet that'll let you move as swiftly as water, though perhaps not quite so swiftly *through* it` have an emphasis on this armor's defense supremacy and speed, which is usually attributed to chemical properties of mercury as a liquid.
- Same motif of speed is found in the [Mercurial Demo Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit) set: `A demo suit made from gremlin technology. It is for the bomber that wants a boost of speed, more power and a greatly reduced chance of dying by electrocution`.

    While it is indeed stated that the armor utilizes gremlin technology, most prominently [Gremlonium](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium): `A highly advanced compound created by gremlin engineers to power their most devious machines. It constantly emits an unsettling hissing sound`, we propose, that there is greater symbolic and alchemical meaning to be found, which will be analyzed after the initial coverage of Clockworks' infrastructure.

But currently, as far as initial role of quicksilvers go, they seem to represent a utilitarian role of batteries, as their gel is found across highly dangerous facilities with electric themes, specifically, [Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory).

Moreover, quicksilver lichens are produced by [slime generators](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant) during the [Vile Engine mission](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine).

We have already discussed the nature of the Rotting Metropolis, using it to interpret existence of those generator in favour of Herex. Yet, the description `It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them` ([The Rotting Metropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Rotting_Metropolis)) is particularly vague.

##### Environmental Themes of Gremlins

One more explanation we may present here is of purely functional role of Slime Generators, unrelated to Herex or general strategic role of the prior.

This proposal states, that slime generators are a method of creating quicksilvers, while generators' poison themes may be attributed to the byproducts, if we are to commit to environmental aspect of gremlins across rank missions, specifically, of [Beyond the Axes of Evil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Beyond_the_Axes_of_Evil): `Despite your previous efforts, gremlins have reformed their logging operation in the Jigsaw Valley in order to supply their munitions plants with resources. Given the results of their last project, the Roarmulus Twins, Spiral HQ would like you to end their eco-destruction before it becomes anything more serious!`

The toxic aspect then is the reimagining of mercury as a toxic chemical element, specifically, its vapours, suggesting a degradation of [quicksilvers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Quicksilver) to [toxigels](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Toxigel), _mirroring the toxicity of expired lithium batteries_.

But, we acknowledge that, as far as this suggestion goes and as it is the only one so far, which manages to plausibly explain an aforementioned design discrepancy, it is based more in the motifs, which, even when focused upon, are rather vague to be confidently substantial, compared to the alchemical theme we were focusing upon throughout the analysis.s

##### Node Field Technology and Gel Glue

In case of gremlins it was creation of artificial subspecies of lichens. As for Spiral Order, there is [Node equipment](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352): `On a related note, while studying slime-compromised knights, our scientists discovered new ways of incorporating slime material into camo. You may find an assortment of these in the Slime Prize Box, which may contain the following: Node Slime Masks; Node Slime Guards; Node Slime Crusher (sword); Node Slime Wall (shield); Writhing Tendrils; Node Field Aura` ([Regarding Slimes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352)).

Given the extent gremlins went with devising purposed species, we can set general boundaries on what to expect from Spiral Order.

There are a few related Node items, which can be acquired from [Slime Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Prize_Box) and [Slime Lockbox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lockbox#Slime_Lockbox) (`A slippery, slimy lockbox won at the Golden Slime Casino. It contains one of many special items. It can be opened with a Slime Key or a Silver Key. On the side, very small markings seem to read "###"` - [Slime Lockbox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Lockbox)):

- `This caloused carving crusher cascades fury upon fatigued foes` ([Node Slime Crusher](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Crusher)).
- `This weathered wobbling wall can withstand a walloping when wielded by unwaveringly willed warriors` ([Node Slime Wall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Wall)).
- `A variegated veiling ward worn by vehemently venerated victors` ([Node Slime Guards](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Guards)).
- `A menacing mask of malice made from obliterated ominous ooze` ([Node Slime Mask](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Mask)).

Apart from the rhythmic writing, the design is one of greater importance here. Most of this equipment contains a glowing image within its slime structure, which, due to similarities to [Node Field Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura), we will refer to as the Node Field - a series of pathways, which, given our current understanding of slime family of monsters could be the very structure which propagates over the main body of a lichen outside of its core, granting resilience. Then there are prismatic [Writhing Tendrils](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Writhing_Tendrils) and the [Node Field Aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura) itself.

In relation to our initial proposal, [Node Container](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Container) and [Node Receiver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Receiver) seem to be devices, linked to the Node Field, as both the container and receiver seem to emit a light meant, based on devises' names, to contain and receive the object it surrounds. In case of the container it is the armor, and for receiver, it seems to be the helm. And given the metallic design of both the accessories and guards, they seem to be intended to be used together.

Considering that the gel core is essential to lichens and jellies, with exception of minis and shankles, it serves as a nerve center, as those make up sentient colonies. Gel Core is likely _capable of producing slime_, similar to bone marrow:

- `An oozing blue lump from a particularly potent gelatinous opponent` ([Brute Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core)).
- `A delicious gummy treat with an impenetrable rocky shell. More than a few teeth have been lost by knights attempting to get at the gooey interior` ([Rocky Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rocky_Core)).
- `A sweet-smelling lump of ooze collected from a particularly noble specimen of slime` ([Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core)).

The underlying pattern is also present in the regular lineup of shields, entirety of the alchemy path of [Royal Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Shield), while it does not glow as the Node equipment. Notably, corresponding equipment, such as armors or helmets, lack such feature and a glowing core, and contrary to those, the regular slime shields have an energy symbol depicted within the structure of the shield. At that note, regular shield lacks a complete, strongly connected geometry with no loose nodes of Node equipment.

We believe, there is a distinction between the energy core - which we came to understand as the _mist energy collector or tank_, and the supposed node field core. Previously we have suggested the energy symbol to be the mist energy collecting device: `The Clockworks and most every machine the knights encounter run on energy, including their own power armor. All knight armor is equipped with a device that is able to constantly pull energy from the air; known as ‘mist,’ into their armor, allowing them to function and power up machinery they encounter. However, mist dissipates almost as quickly as it is acquired, and thus a knight’s mist energy can never be permanently stored ... Due to the intense power source at Cradle's core, the entire planet's atmosphere is imbued with loose, airborne mist energy. Each Spiral Knight will constantly absorb this mist energy` ([Energy - Lore - Cory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Energy&oldid=20)), but, the glowing core of Node Field equipment has remained unknown. More so, there are other armors with seem to contain this element of technology, specifically, the modern plated armors, with [ancient]() and [volcanic]() variants possessing no such device on the front.

Given our understanding, we propose, that this element is indeed an artificial device meant to create environment - the Node Field, - for the gathered slime to be manipulated for defensive measures of the armor. While a speculation, paired with our earlier discussion regarding those armors, as well as the context of energy tanks on knight's armor, we propose this device being the secondary power source, attributed for plated armors to their weight, and for Node field technology - its power source.

One particular element then remains, that of [Node Field aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura) itself, as it extends past the knight into the surroundings. At the same time, the [promotional material](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Prize_Box#Calendar) also depicts what seems to be _Node Field chamber_.

Due to this design choice we lean to a conclusion that the Node Field, at first, is a technology. But, as its design differs greatly from the rest of Spiral Order equipment, we have to assume that it is derived from a different place and time, as far as this concept can go. And to hold the structure of the gel itself through those artificial means, [Jelly Glue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Glue) was manufactured: `A viscous compound developed by Biotechs to allow for the study of slime creatures. When mixed with slime and jelly matter, it allows for reshaping without losing its form. Though reserved for scientific purposes, the process is generally regarded as 'super fun'`, which seem to be a fitting to a degree candidate for the substance Node equipment utilizes.

It is also here a distinction between slime and jelly matter is made, which, given context, seem to be a far more advanced solution to utilization of slime. We arrive to such conclusion mainly by the fact of Node field technology seemingly requiring Node container to operate, which, as we have proposed, is used to contain the jelly components, while Jelly Glue makes the process of manufacture easier and grants shapeshifting capabilities to the material.

But, given existence of a regular lineup or jelly-based armors and the recency of the discovery (`On a related note, while studying slime-compromised knights, our scientists discovered new ways of incorporating slime material into camo` - [Regarding Slimes](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352)), we would suggest those being a later development without utilization of Node field, rather relying on the Jelly Glue. If we are to develop this idea further, it is this alchemy tree's equipment can be alchemized at the Sanctuary Alchemy Machine, which seem to contain most advanced equipment in terms of found on Cradle materials.

##### Starlight Cradle and Ancient Titans

As we have [mentioned earlier themes of dreams amongst lichens](), it is here we will discuss it proper.

There is Starlight Cradle, while it is of the same nature as the rest of Aurora Isles, it is distinguished by the presence of sleep mist, instrumental to its design: `Beneath a moonlit sky azure islands drift in a sea of stars. These islands are home to creatures that are more than happy to creep upon those who succumb to this world's endless lullaby` ([Starlight Cradle](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle)).

Meteor motif within this region in particular is more so interesting, as is it on meteor lichens were supposed to arrive, and the region has Meteor Mile in 3 different variants of a fixed layout. This seems intentional, both in naming and design. Not particularly related to the region, a [scenario room with a smoldering meteor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Lichenous_Lair_1.png) exist, but, it seems to be too recent of an event, due to burning fires. Due to this, it is left unknown weather this is the original meteor lichens had arrived on Cradle, but one related as a phenomenon, as it is due to that the area has such specific name.

There is also the [Torporal Titan](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan), but before it, we must look at properties of the equipment, alchemized from this region's materials. It is also here, at Meteor Mile 2, we can see a direct parallel and common motif of both Gun Puppy constructs and gun puppy statues placed nearby, as if _the mechanical ones are meant to mirror more ancient stonework ones_.

Among currently present sequences of levels, only [Torporal Titan](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan) lacks a narrative in its name. [Stygian Steeds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Stygian_Steeds) were present during the events of the Return of Ur, as the stygian, or Underworld, steeds are trojans of the legion of Ur, as they were sealed in the Underworld. And [Briar Bone Barrage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Concrete_Jungle/Briar_Bone_Barrage) is seemingly named after a unique encounter with [Toxilargo](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxilargo#Toxilargo), but here we can rely on previous levels, whose names mark the extent of the poisonous miasma.

The location of Starlight Cradle is more structurally intact compared to the rest of the regions of, initially, the same biome. As the rest of Aurora Isles, this region had also been populated by tortomega, but, due to relation to meteors and unique state lichens are found in, it was overtaken by the latter in the same manner as Royal Jelly Palace. Potentially being the source of all lichens. Yet, this would not explain nature of sleep here, which we will analyze next.

Themes of stars and sleep are related. Most of the related to this location gear uses [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core) (`A pungent mass pulled from a slimy assailant. Its aroma is an excellent remedy for insomnia, as well as nighttime sniffling and sneezing` - [Zee Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core)) in its alchemy:

- [Starlit Demo Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Demo_Suit) 5-star armor has usage of both [Royal Core](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core), and [Meteor Mote](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Meteor_Mote), which is stated to be used by gremlins: `A small piece of a rare material that is said to have fallen from the sky. Gremlins typically use it in the construction of power sources`.

  This further suggests this region being related to meteors in the context of lichens' arrival to Cradle, and even gremlins, potentially introducing them to further creation of artificial slime subspecies'. Considering that the meteor had to end up at Cradle's surface, and the Aurora Isles are particularly aerial region, this might not be a coincidence, but an intentional decision for both explaining lichens' origins and to disclose more regions of tortomega civilization beyond Wildwoods and general Aurora Isles.

  It was suggested, that the terrain was harvested from the surface of Cradle (`The Clockworks are a manufactured place, perhaps the worlds they contain are harvested from the terrain above. But how?`- [Recon Module: Gloaming Wildwoods - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)) when Clockworks construction had initially began. Due to this, existence of slimes species on Cradle may be one preceding gremlins'.

  Aurora Isles, notably, as we now know, are the place of Ironwood to be harvested, relating back to the question of the resources required to potentially construct tortodrones in the first place and then the Roarmulus Twins by gremlins.

- `An advanced, star-soaked hunting coat that will keep you awake even as it coddles you in downy comfort` ([Starlit Hunting Coat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Coat)). A wording of star-soaked is peculiar - as it is unknown weather this is a metaphor. If this property is to be interpreted literally, then, we are thinking of the sleep-inducing mist, naturally secreted by [Slooms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloom#Sloom) and [Sloombargos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloombargo#Sloombargo).

  This mist then is addressed directly:

  - `A powerful alchemical bomb that creates a thick fog of sleepy mist` ([Slumber Squall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Squall)).
  - `A Slumber Smogger modified to disperse sleepy smog over a wider range` ([Slumber Smogger Mk II](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Smogger_Mk_II)).
  - `An alchemical bomb that fogs an area with a sleep agent` ([Slumber Smogger](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Smogger)).
  - `An illuminated helm strengthened against soporific smogs. its surprisingly soft inside` ([Starlit Demo Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Demo_Helm)).
  - `An advanced hunting cap, illuminated and downy, that resists the strongest sleep mists` ([Starlit Hunting Cap](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Cap)).

  The nature of this mist will be important later.

- `Something has really riled up the Chromalisks in the levels below the town of Emberlight. Spiral HQ sent a squad in to investigate and they quickly fell off the radar. Now they've sent out a distress signal stating that they're cornered at depth 21 by chromalisks of all varieties. Biotechs speculate these chromalisks are agitated due to their proximity to the Core` ([In Cold Blood](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/In_Cold_Blood)). This mission ends in the location, by the gate icon and by its design, in the Starlight Cradle - [Lizard Lounge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/In_Cold_Blood/Lizard_Lounge).
- [Slooms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloom#Sloom) and [Sloombargos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloombargo#Sloombargo) have a unique design of spikes, which are covered with ornamen glowing patterns.

  This shattered or cracked design is similar to other entities, such as [Gorgos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo#Gorgo), Margrel, [corrupted tortodrones](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone), and [trojans](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan). Although all of those examples are some of other way relate to Underworld, we believe this case, sleep is not related to Underworld, but it demonstrates a potentially different concept.

- Items of [Slumber Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Prize_Box) also relate to this region through the color scheme.
- The [Slime Lockbox](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lockbox#Slime_Lockbox) also contains trinkets relating to a time of day - 3-star [Early Riser Ring](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Early_Riser_Ring), 4-star [Dawn Bracelet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dawn_Bracelet), 5-star [Daybreaker Band](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Daybreaker_Band), all being synonyms of dawn.
- The [Jelly Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_shield) alchemy tree, including [Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise), provides sleep resistance.

  We have earlier proposed, that [Savage Tortoise](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise) was designed by Owlites, but, there're no evidence of lichens existing that far into the past, not evidence of Owlites combating lichens. Although, it would not conflict with the existing timeline of events. More potential connections arise from earlier upgrades - `A shield alchemized from a hardened tortodrone shell. Its tough enough to dull a jelly barb on impact` ([Wild Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Shell)). In fact, we still do not known the _nature of explicitly hardened shells derived of tortodrones_.

- The [Purrfect Katnip Pouch](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Purrfect_Katnip_Pouch) provides sleep resistance and is acquired for 100 [Primal Sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens), design-wise it is fitting.
- `An ordinary object with a unique texture and weight, the result of having been partially digested by a Sloombargo` ([Somnambulist's totem](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Somnambulist%27s_Totem)). Naming of a totem is peculiar, as there are only 2 other instances of a totem naming scheme being used, - gremlin and Underworld devices. As Apocrea was mention within the [memorandum](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111472), and we have briefly mentioned it, here, we can focus on this concept. This naming of a totem within the context of Apocrea could be referencing Lovecraft's short story "Hypnos" and broader Dream Cycle, _as both relate to the greater physical effects of events within dreams on the perceived reality_.

##### Torporal Titans

We propose that at the center of region's identity and reason for its in-universe existence is the nature of the sleep mist, and it is one to be derived from tortomega. This connection we make due to the earlier lack of context for the Torporal Titan. Naming convention of titan is very rare and _is used selectively_ across items and places with at least some background.

For ancient equipment acquired for [Almirian Seals](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Token#Almirian_Seal), the [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor) and [Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm), it was the thematic relation to moss and immense, titanic (`A vestigial helm whose weight makes it unwieldy to all but those with titanic strength` - [Ancient Plate Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm)), - strength, affirmed by the slowness of movement, as the items were made of stone, and mean for bearer of such power to carry those. Here we reference the Ironmight set, which design-wise is similar, yet relates to different epoch of Ironmight kingdom, yet still heavy to induce slowness. It should be noted, that ancient equipment is also detrimental to sleep status effect.

Then the Titan Arcade gates were a key to establishing titans, tortomega, and creators of tortodrones, as labels for one ancient species of tortomega.

And here [Torporal Titan](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan) is an unchanging depth of 3 arenas within a seemingly intact location and architecture, reminiscent of stone halls of Gloaming Wildwoods, the [Roarsterous Ruins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Roarsterous_Ruins). Considering the context of the location, _designed as the rest of Aurora Isles and containing the same strata of ruins_, we believe, this naming convention was intentional. While sleep may be related to titans, here it explicitly states the location to be the torporal titan itself - a slumbering or sleeping titan, a giant, if we refer to the exploration of the concept of titans in relation to Valkyries and [mysterious statues in their halls]().

It is then why a titan is sleeping? Given out proposal of titans being hunted by Undercorp through corruption of tortomega, we can speculate of those falling into a prolonged sleep for the threat to subside. On the other hand, the dormant state of titans may be inflicted by currently unknown properties of so called primordial lichens, which inhabit the region of Starlight Cradle, but, there are also no evidence for such narrative to exist.

Due to this, as a working proposal, we are leaning into, what we consider, satisfying narrative, of remaining titans felling veiled homeland, followed by falling into a slumber, which utilized said sleeping mist, _ironically reminiscent of the cursed miasma_, to sleep util Undercorp becomes less of a threat.

##### Ice Queen

Ice Queen and rest of [Ice Cubes](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Cube#Ice_Cube) can be grouped together as both have same freeze-related nature. Ice Cubes in particular can be re-frosted through application of frost status effect. As everfrost is extracted from freeze-themed enemies, and if anything, the state Royal Jelly Palace found in, __frozen over Royal Jelly Palace is most reminiscent of frozen Amu-Sol with everfrost's influence__.

As we have not seen Amu-Sol in its regular environment - as a regular dark city, but, have witness both instances of Royal Jelly Palace, we suspect of the same power to alter entirety of the environment to be used, none other than presence of everfrost, a material, which came from Underworld.

As Maulos was involved with Amu-Sol, we suggest freezing of Royal Jelly Palace being of Ice Queen's doing, rather than a natural phenomenon, due to innate nature of Ice Cubes, as they are capable of generating ice on their own will.

Previously we have discussed how gremlins have engineered artificial subspecies of slime family of monsters, but the context of explicit royalty appearing in tandem with the Swarm seems too specific.

Then there is presence of evil eye imagery on Ice Queen's crown, seen both of her variant, and one alchemized in the Sanctuary Alchemy Machine. We rely on it through connection to everfrost, as both had originated from the Underworld. The crown itself is made of [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore), as suggested by the description of the latter: `It is often completely wasted on crowns and jewelry for slime royalty` ([Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore)). It was stated that slimes had overtaken the palace, so it could mean, in conjunction with usage of the ore in valkyrian armor, [Heavenly Iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) specifically, that slime royalty had found the ore as heavenly kingdom was long gone, and created a crown. But why would the imagery of an eye, associated with the Underworld, be placed onto the crow of slime royalty?

Given our work throughout the previous chapters, we consider the Underworld, or Undercorp specifically, to the perpetrators behind later events while the Swarm takes main priority as the threat. How those relate to each other, we have previously suggested in the [analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel](), but the specifics and, most importantly, _the means are still left unknown_.

Other than that, we are leaning to the idea of Ice Queen's presence correlating with other events revolving around Shadow Lairs, initially proposed in the [final analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel]().

##### Golden Slime Casino

In relation to both Jelly Kingdom and Undercorp, there is a location within the Clockworks, which is essentially a casino, populated by both parties and named the [Golden Slime Casino](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino).

From there we gat a few trivia regarding operation of Undercorp and potentially other companies from Underworld, the Jelly Kingdom, as well as physiology of jellies, despite the joking nature of the location:

- `I just got back from debarber, can you tell?` ([Golden Slime Casino - Jelly Cube](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino)).

  This quality of barbs to be removed, which we earlier identified to be calcified slime, was also observed by geoknights across Cradle at least for Ice Cubes:

  - `Don't mind Hubert, he's been de-spiked` ([Clockworks - Scenario Room - Geo Knight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scenario_room)).
  - [Haven Lab](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lab) in particular contains de-spiked Ice Cube.

- `One day I’ll win enough to build my own palace! Glorp glorp!` ([Golden Slime Casino - Jelly Cube](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino)). This implies, that with enough crown, which are established to be also used by Jelly Kingdom, one could achieve a status of nobility within the hierarchy of the kingdom. This would also lead to the earlier method of jellies incorporating cores to be not the only method one can become a nobility, but rather the status of a colony itself, as an organism, grants physical power, demonstrated by lichen colonies and instances of jelly royalty across Cradle. This can be a reasonable suggestion, given that Ice Queen has only 3 cores, instead of any larger number, observed the prior instances, and the fact she is stated to have usurped the palace: `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and it's king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!` ([Shadows Fall Over Cradle!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/29852)).

The jelly norse of the casino is identified as the royal jelly, also evident by its crown. Notably, this instance of royal jelly seemingly has a single royal core, which further contributes to a newer suggestion of kingdom's nature of nobility as one close to reality.

What is the relation of devilites to the casino, then? The [Yesmen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman) at the [casino](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Golden_Slime_Casino) state:

- `Everyjelly is welcome at the Golden Slime!`
- `I’m sorry, you missed Happy Hour by a minute. Next time.`
- `Everyjelly is a winner at the Golden Slime!`
- `Undercorp employees get a free mug with every visit.`

Those quotes, we believe, hint at a business relation, wherein devilites and companies of Underworld had their part in the existence of the casino, given they have special, although trivial, privileges. Finally, it is existence of the casino within Clockworks which may point to gremlins having a more multifaceted relation to Undercorp.

Within the themes of the casino, we can identify presence of _noir_, both through environemnt of the location and addition of High Wobbler Longue, wherein the latter explores this theme slightly further through its design, separate from the rest of the casino. Herein __noir is a sign of narrative's ambigious morality seen through comedic rendition and art style__, which create a particular, _lingering contrast_.

#### Gremlin Mending Rune, the Emblem

Gremlin Mending rune is a spell performed by gremlin menders of Darkfang clan.

This symbol is also identical to Spiral Order's gremlin enemy type classification image, and also, judging by general appearances, it is a consistent image across all gremlin clans.

Based on the fact that Crimson Order imagery is consistent across the facilities, we suggest that this more generalized symbol, an emblem, is of the Great Colony, Iron Law, or closely associated with those, as all known clans abide to the latter.

Weather it is Great Colony's emblem or symbol of order, might be resolved through the design of [Gremlin Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Prize_Box). It is similar to the depiction of the familiar Spiral Order symbol on the [Raider Prize Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box).

More important in this context is the design of [Gremlin Suit](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Suit), as on its sleeves there is a symbol belonging to the Spiral Order, rather than one of gremlins'. The lockbox itself bears the symbol. This parity of symbols and corresponding affiliations may allow to understand the meaning of gremlins' emblem precisely.

We start from the quote: `A village of outcasts, Emberlight serves as a refuge for gremlins who were banished from the Great Colony. Now they live humble lives, selling wares and repairs to passing travelers, always fearful that one day the gremlin king Tinkinzar would see fit to wipe them out entirely` ([Emberlight](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight)). One could be banished from the Order, being a discharge or dismissal, or from a habitat. Within this and earlier interpretations, we will consider Great Colony as a location, a metropolis.

##### Clans and Minerals

Then there are gremlin wares, such as toolboxes, which have familiar symbol engraved on them. In this direction of tools as a theme, we may look at gremlin mender's staff - a wrench with a mineral, identified as the [Wrench Wand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wrench_Wand): `A heavy hand tool favored by Gremlins. It's good for both tightening bolts and cracking skulls`. Due to presence of gremlin menders all across Clockworks, we can gather, that there exists a parity of prime mineral and gremlin clans, wherein, seemingly, mineral's color sets the prime color of the clan.

With this approach in mind, we can identify that parity:

- Tenderfoot clan gremlins have patches of their emblem with green background, menders utilize Valestone in their spells, placed within the wrench.
- Ironclaw clan is primarily yellow, with luminite being the mineral used by menders
- Darkfang clan is purple, menders of darkfang clan use dark matter, and are the only clan capable of reviving recently fallen gremlins.

As for the rune and its healing properties, it can be applied by gremlin menders to both other living entities as well constructs, including battlepods. In its behavior it resembles healing field of Silkwings, and the rune's emblem shimmers as the dread seal. Menders cast that rune through usage of a wrench equipped with luminite shard, which may point to identity of the principle behind healing.

There are also [healing totems](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Healing_Totem#Healing_Totem), found in the Firestorm Citadel after Nature Sprites had began putting out the fires. Those totems also resemble wrenches with mineral shards held within, which function as passive mending. As for their purpose, considering Herex's presence with a large squad of both gremlins and constructs, we suggest totems' placement here is the evidence of them passing through this route prior to knight's arrival.

Given the abilities of mender channeled through those specific mineral, we may consider those being charged variants of minerals, as those are effectively used in combat, such as [Sun Shards bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards): `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite. Whatever you do, don't look directly at it`.

But, apart from this pattern, gremlins do utilize all minerals in their weapons. Most common example here is the group of gremlin - knockers, - which are equipped with 2 smaller wrenches, but each with a different mineral. It seems that it is the interaction between those minerals which causes an explosion, which is weaponized:

- [Knocker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Knocker): moonstone and crimsonite, inflicts no status effect.
- [Lighter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Lighter): crimsonite and luminite, inflicts fire.
- [Cooler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Cooler): valestone and moonstone, inflicts frost
  - [Deadly Crystal Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb) consists of moonstone and valestone alloy, elemental damage (`A large chunk of Moonstone and Valestone alloy primed with a potent explosive. Studies have shown that this bomb can be used to reduce a zombie's craving for brains by up to 100% by blowing them to pieces` - [Deadly Crystal Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb)).
- [Choker](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Choker): valestone and dark matter, inflicts poison.
- [Jumper](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Jumper): moonstone and dark matter, inflicts shock.

Notably, those are the _uncommon-type combinations of minerals_ found across Clockworks, as evident by the [mineral frequency table](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Minerals#Acquisition), with moonstone-crimsonite being attributed rather to general gremlin stratum. Could it be, this __strategic placement of minerals is explained by their explosive nature__ of their interactions? But then, why frequent minerals are also present in those speculated to be dangerous combinations?

This emerging relation between minerals' themes, their natures, tethered by their application across Isoran and Gremlin technology made us think of a different notion, of concept of Five Elements in Godai.

Although interpretation within the context of fictional reality of Spiral Knights will differ, we will attempt to look for similarities and common themes, such as the aforementioned relations of statuses and minerals.

For that, minerals' descriptions should be brought to the shortest description:

- Crimsonite - passion, anger, strength
- Dark Matter - chaos, nothingness
- Luminite - faith, wisdom, zeal
- Moonstone - knowledge
- Valestone - essence of life

Dark matter is described as as essence of both chaos and nothingness. We have already discussed how this duality relates back to western alchemy. But what we have not mentioned up until now is the relation to Godai and its concept of the Void or Ku, as its fifth element, in most simple terms here being the abstraction of the being, it is the world spirit, cosmic Heaven. We must point out, Ku currently has no relation to the Void of Whitespace in particular, but it has very similar cosmic motif, as Energy is also ever-present - a notion, [discussed under similar motifs in relation to existence of auras and souls](), - a concept we are to explore deeper soon enough.

This relation of one of most prevalent to the timeline minerals - dark matter, - being used by one of more dangerous and deepest clans, seem to correlate with a different notion of _gremlins using shadow-based weaponry in the most severe cases_. And with this application the __symbolism of Underworld emerges, seemingly imprinting itself on gremlins' designs__, with such designs being the [Collector](), [Incinerators](), and [Electron bombs](), to name a few. Where this notion culminates, we are yet to see through.

##### Emblem of the Great Colony

Given this context of gremlin clans, what is then the emblem? As we have earlier suggested a parity between symbol of Spiral Order and of gremlins', we are leaning to the idea of the latter being a representation for a concept, rather than a location.

As Spiral Order is to Isorans, so something is to gremlins, represented by their corresponding symbol. And with our current understanding that missing element is the Iron Law, a core principle behind the existing social structure of gremlins on Cradle, and the __emblem of the Great Colony__, as the latter could not exist without the prior.

We can compare the outfits of Emberlight gremlins to ones of Great Colony - those possess an emblem of a circled cross, the imagery present across the town of Emberlight, as well as its districts, traversed [during the events of Winterfest]. This emblem, we believe, literally and symbolically crosses out the idea, represented by the Great Colony gremlins' emblem - of a bolt, placed into teeth of a wrench, and the Iron Law (`Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins` - [Haven - Laboratory - Pakrat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat)).

#### Minerals, Dread Velvet, and Complex 357

If we further look into applications of minerals, we come by a certain notion, observed within complex 357 and [Biscotti's kitchen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Total_Caketastrophe!/Chaos_in_the_Kitchen) of all places - of minerals being grinded into a powder, - of Valestone in the complex and dark matter in the kitchen.

Furthermore, as seen during [A Gremlin in Knead](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Gremlin_in_Knead) mission, possessed by [Dread Velvet](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Velvet#Dread_Velvet) [Groat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Groat) was using moonstone for currently unknown means: `A dash of Moonstone, a pinch of...` ([A Gremlin in Knead - Moonstone Mixup - Groat](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Gremlin_in_Knead/Moonstone_Mixup)).

We propose, the observed [Creep Cakes]() were _already sentient and hostile due to application of dark matter_, introduced by Biscotti: `
To speed up the process I may have used a teensy weensy bit of pure, unrefined, dark matter instead of baking powder... In any case it would seem that this new 'recipe' caused the cakes to turn into horrible monsters that have overtaken my kitchen and infested the Clockworks` ([Total Caketastrophe! - Chaos in the Kitchen - Biscotti](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Total_Caketastrophe!/Chaos_in_the_Kitchen)).

We can suggest that those cakes are the result of _both_ dark matter and moonstone being introduced into the recipe: `He disappeared into the clockworks soon after Biscotti delivered the last crate of batter` ([A Gremlin in Knead](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Gremlin_in_Knead)). There no major examples of moonstone capable of causing a behavior reminiscent to dark matter. And, it is dark matter, which has identical behavior on non-hostile entities across other cases of its introduction, most reminiscent of [corrupted tortodrones]().

As no information is present in regards to Groat, apart from him disappearing into the Clockworks as peculiar (`He disappeared into the clockworks` - [A Gremlin in Knead](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Gremlin_in_Knead)) and the fact Creep Cakes with dark matter have infested the Clockworks, we lean into the idea of dark matter-based Creep Cakes invading Emberlight and by that time already possessing Groat. Those event were then later amplified by introduction of moonstone through actions of Dread Velvet possessing Groat.

As for Dread Velvet - it has a capacity to _inflict curse_, which is reminiscent of Darkfire Lord Vanaduke and Carnavons, as all of those are associated with dark matter. But, as far as we have analyzed properties of dark matter and its adjacent themes, we can derive 2 elements from Dread Velvet:

- Supposedly, introduction of dark matter is what gave rise to its consciousness and power over curse, distinct from other Creep Cakes.
- The dread naming convention here is tied to curse and its color, as Dread Velvet has a distinct pink color scheme.

Then Moonstone was added later by Groat in Emberlight's kitchen, which seemingly gave shock properties to those cakes, as well as an ability to power constructs.

Given later found elite knights near Groat fight, we can suggest, that those moonstone-empowered creep cakes have an ability to possess constructs. This ability is also found in the form of events revolving around Groat, as he was possessed by Dread Velvet, and as current cakes, as they are referred, possess retrodes, or [batterbots](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Retrode#Batterbot). In both cases damage to the host is required in order for the possessor to leave.

We have earlier discussed a correlation of moonstone and electricity, and, most present in relation to Quicksilver and a few other motifs.

##### Mineral Powder, Creep Cakes, and Sprite Food

The pattern of minerals being grinded to powder is present in several instances. As this property is focused upon in complex 357, we believe, the properties of minerals in this state - as dust, - serve an important role to the research within the complex, and potentially, contents of the [schematics]().

Given our [prior exploration of complex 357](), we have identified a few pools of minerals to which those are pumped with tubes. Nearby those pools usually is located a chamber, containing several discrete instances of minerals placed in proximity of 2 opposing gears - a design, which was observed norse-east of [Biscotti's kitchen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Total_Caketastrophe!/Chaos_in_the_Kitchen): [a small chamber with minerals and gears, and a tube nearby leading to a pool of dark matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Total_Caketastrophe!-Chaos_in_the_Kitchen-2.png).

This design is most reminiscent of an industrial rotary shredder, which is relatively applicable to minerals in order to grind those into smaller pieces.

The result of those minerals being grinded either to gel or powder is less explicitly direct due to the design of the output. There are not a few real-world minerals, which possess similar properties, such as electrical charge and paste-like texture, but, given current focus of dust, as a more common result, Biscotti's comment (`To speed up the process I may have used a teensy weensy bit of pure, unrefined, dark matter instead of baking powder...` - [Total Caketastrophe! - Chaos in the Kitchen - Biscotti](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Total_Caketastrophe!/Chaos_in_the_Kitchen)), presence of Battle Sprite foods named and depicted as dust seem to be a more concrete evidence of minerals to be grinded into dust, such as [Power Dust of Crimsonite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Power_Dust), [Shadow Dust of Dark Matter](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Dust), and [Divine Dust of Luminite](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Dust) - we believe those pools are representations of _mineral powder or grinded down mineral dust_. Those names suggest a link, which was established back in the first chapter of minerals fitting with specific concepts, such as rage or raw power, darkness, frenzy and wind, and, divinity of luminite.

If we attempt to extrapolate creation of Creep Cakes as _inanimate objects given sentience through dark matter_, where would those properties could have been applied within the context of high-secrecy military developments? And if so, what are the properties of other minerals when integrated as such medium into other creations, considering their descriptions?

##### Minerals and Souls: Part 4 - Conclusions, Isorans

As far as we are aware of the metaphysics of dark matter and minerals in general:

- Minerals can be placed into a tortodrone _to animate it as much as other charged minerals_, specifically, crimsonite, as it is powering uncorrupted tortodrones.
- There are instances of tortofist-derived weapons, which weaponize minerals' charge by _firing charged mineral rounds_, which capable of exploding.
- There are trojans, which we concluded to be an instance of different phenomenon - of _mineral forming through influx of curse_, with other instances being Carnavons and Lord Vanaduke.
- _Minerals' energy can bridge realms_ through specific placement adorned by fiendish sigils drawn of same mineral, consequently _summoning entities from underworld or banishing them from material realm_.
- Minerals power it can _protect from fiendish influence_.
- There is gremlin technology, which _allow minerals' power to be channeled to heal and revive_.
- With mineral glyphs can be made, which, when inscribed onto pages or form a text, _grant the object an aura_ and inner power.
- Minerals, when incorporated onto inanimate objects, _can grant sentience and life_.

Given those capabilities of minerals, the scope of effects can, of course, vary greatly. But, all of those characteristics follow a principle, which we have established as the [metaphysical stack](), - of energy flowing from the highest realm, manifesting in material realm in many variants, including the minerals, auras, souls, crystal and mist energy.

As if each strand of energy was by itself, when untied from physical medium, capable of traversing these realms. This energy, by staying and being amassed, then, is what allows for a soul, or sentience, to exists - a notion established back during the [analysis of souls]().

It is also here we can finally suggest the precise physical nature of Isorans. Previously we have suggested that aura comprised the physical body of the soul, as both are tied together. Then we have proposed that Isorans, despite their looks, have a skeletal structure within, identifying their species and ones of Almire as one. This proposal had led us to understand Isorans as corporeal entities with a skeletal structure, but with unknown composition of the rest.

Now, we propose, that, given the earlier revival system, Isorans are deeply tied to the nature of energy, with their rest of bodies being as such - manifestations of auras, which are corporeal form of energy, close to the [celestial suits]().

With this logic, [Torin's opened burning coffin](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_variant.jpg) would retain the corporeal form, as he returned to the Citadel as a spirit, revived through energy of the Core, _with his semi-corporeal ghostly form being his aura_.

##### Creep Cakes

In case of Creep Cakes, this seems to us to be a _more advanced application of the same case as dark matter and crimsonite were used to power tortodrones_.

Moonstone then, when introduced to Creep Cakes, allows for an elemental connection to electricity to be established, a theme, which was noted several times so far.

In terms of relation to Sprite Foods, given currently established nature of all 3, the progression from more common terms of mote to stone changes to orb and star in the tiers of sprite foods of the [Sprite Food Alchemy Machine](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sprite_Food_Alchemy_Machine). This change from unrefined objects to more abstract shapes, seems us, as a symbolic element of a larger picture, which we are to explore soon enough.

#### Clockworks and Magitech

When speaking of Clockworks, inevitably, eventually, the Core and the Architect had to be brought up. Here we will attempt to parse Clockworks in the current state they are found in, working downwards from the most present in-game elements to ones that are less common.

##### Roarmulus Twins' Power Source

We begin with the [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser), which as we remember was the Spark of Life before energy system rework (`The old ‘Spark of Life’ crafting material has been renamed to 'Storm Chaser'` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)). Now it is important, that this update came after one which had introduced Roarmulus Twins: [Built to Destroy! 7-6-2011](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/14006), while the Voltedge was introduced in Blast Network update of [Release Notes 2011-08-02](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-08-02).

- The [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser) is referenced in [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) as a payload of unstable organic essence: `An Electron Bomb modified with a payload of unstable organic essence. Foes caught in its punishing radius are cruelly referred to as "thunderstuck"` ([Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex)). Electron Vortex for the first time has appeared in the Blast Network update.
- [Storm Chaser](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser) is then used in creation of [Voltedge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Voltedge): `Combining Spiral capacitor technology with samples recovered from the Ironclaw Munitions Factory produced the blade, which can output a particularly hazardous 1.21 gigawatt discharge`.

This would most likely mean, that __Roarmulus Twins' laser canons utilize Storm Chasers to power themselves__, as the material is the source of power for the blade, apart from which no other equivalent material was found.

This demonstrates the applied power of an elemental - and potentially, and even more importantly, - the potential of all 5-star essences, when we [had to discover and compare them against fiendish glyphs]().

Due to this, we can extrapolate this concept onto [Red Roarmulus Twins](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Red_Roarmulus_Twins), by which they had to utilize [flame souls](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul), as a _fiery counterparts to shock_.

##### Blast Furnaces

More so, the suggestion of gremlins' application of flame souls across heavy industry is further affirmed by alchemy and description of [Combuster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Combuster): `Combining the principles of the Skylark's engines with the technology powering the Blast Furnace produced this brutal blade, which can ignite even the most flame-retardant materials at a distance`. We can identify the technology powering Blast Furnaces through the analysis of the rest of alchemy line of Combuster: `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of fire` ([Fireburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fireburst_Brandish)).

##### Battlepod Shielding

The only material which is added to this 3-star blade, compared to 2-star [Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brandish), is [Torchstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torchstone): `A small rock that smolders constantly. Gremlins patrolling the Cooling Chambers occasionally use them as a hand warmer`. We can guess that it is a seemingly magic-infused material and one containing inner energy reminiscent of Fire Crystals or even minerals proper. It is also the one material used to transmute [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield). [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield) and [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield) are the only shield with _visible patterns as of breakable battlepod hexagonal shields_. Battlepod's shield are, notably, pink, which through the color scheme of the prior 2 transmutable shields, the way we see to be made with _dark matter_, as fiery variant of those shields is orange, as frost variant is light-blue.

This hexagonal pattern contrasts the impenetrable shielding of Roarmulus Twins, gremlin shields, battlepods, etc., which, as we have discussed in relation to [Roarmulus Twins and Ironwood](), is at least related to wood-derived properties, and on the latter end - to a more widespread usage of such materials for a common goal of shielding manufacture, be it devilites, empires of pre-Clockworks Cradle, or gremlins.

##### Cooling Chambers

As [Torchstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torchstone) is used to transmute [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield), so [Hailstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hailstone) is used for [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield). [Hailstone](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hailstone) same as its fiery counterpart, contains elemental energy, as suggested by the description of [Iceburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iceburst_Brandish): `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of ice`, - it is a 3-star upgrade to 2-star [Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brandish).

Iceburst Brandish is followed by 4-star [Blizzbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand): `A high-tech blade that fuses Spiral and Clockwork Technology. It can produce a concentrated low-temperature explosion that is harmless to knights`, which is part of a similar in description line for brandishes. The material of the recipe is a [Perfect_Snowball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perfect_Snowball). Although we can argue, as it is also acquired for 10 [primal sparks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens), it a magical material, but potentially not a gremlin technology, although there are snow-themed Glinchlin clan of gremlins.

Compared to perfect snowball, there are other 4-star material in the alchemy tree of adjacent brandishes, ones are [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball): `An orb of pure electricity that is typically found at the bottom of the sea of all places` and [Blaze Pepper](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blaze_Pepper): `A delectable spice prized by Clockworks denizens of all sorts. In powdered form, it has a terrible habit of clinging to absolutely everything`, whose origins are currently vague.

4-star [Blizzbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand) is upgraded then to [Glacius](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacius): `Mixing some advanced theories on cryogenics with the technology powering the Cooling Chamber produced this advanced armament, which is capable of flash-freezing the most formidable of foes`. New 5-star material is [Everfrost](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost), and the description of the blade `capable of flash-freezing the most formidable of foes` matches now [known powers of everfrost](). This, we believe, establishes __everfrost as an unnatural - one of Underworld origin, - cooling mechanism at the foundations of the cooling chambers__.

##### Power Complexes and Spiral Power Sources

Backing to [Blazebreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield) and [Blizzbreak Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield). The [Surge Breaker Shield](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Surge_Breaker_Shield) introduces a greater importance of shock status within gremlin technological advancements. It is transmuted through introduction of 3-star [Volt Oil](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volt_Oil): `A slippery substance that always holds a slight electrical charge`.

Rather than being of gremlins' invention, Volt Oil is suggested to be Spiral Technology, in the description of [Kilowatt Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kilowatt_Pulsar): `A Pulsar upgraded with Spiral technology to deliver an unpleasant shock on impact. Pulsar shots become more powerful the further they travel`. But, it is still elemental essence of lightning, as 3-star [Shockburst Brandish](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shockburst_Brandish) describes addition of Volt Oil: `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of lightning`.

A 4-star upgrade, [Boltbrand](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Boltbrand), introduces [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball): `An orb of pure electricity that is typically found at the bottom of the sea of all places`. Here we also can guess that this material - Volt Oil, - was initially identified by Spiral Order due to [Plasma Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Capacitor): `The addition of an advanced Spiral power source gives this bomb a shockingly large blast radius`, as it is a 4-star upgrade of [Lightning Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lightning_Capacitor): `An upgraded Capacitor that can explode with the fury of an electrical storm`. Despite it, the technology of large, weaponized capacitors belong to gremlins - [Static Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Capacitor): `An explosive device of Gremlin origin designed to produce a deadly field of electricity`, which tells us of the _ability of Spiral Order to make advancements based on gremlin technology_.

It is here we can resolve the origin of [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball), as it is the new material and one referred as the `Spiral power source` ([Plasma Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Capacitor)). With this, [Blaze Pepper](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blaze_Pepper) and [Perfect Snowball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perfect_Snowball) seem to be also widespread natural occurrences, not restricted to Cradle's ecosystem. Given Isoran focus on alchemy, the description of [Perfect Snowball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perfect_Snowball): `An icy snowball of almost mythical perfection. Though it begs to be thrown squarely into the side of someone's head, it would be best to use in alchemy`, is one we can view from the perspective of SPiral Order biotechs, utilizing its unique property in alchemy, - the __process which goes beyond physical nature of material, but rather utilizing their perception and themes to create tools__.

Within this context usage of [Thunderball](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball) in [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb): `Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock`, - suggests that electron variant of graviton bomb is of Isoran origin, but, the description of [Electron Charge](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Charge): `A small electro-explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a crippling vortex of electricity`, and its acquisition from King Krogmo devilites, we believe, counters this proposal, establishing __electron variant of the vortex as one of gremlin technology__, with the latter pattern of Spiral Order building upon the preexisting gremlin technology. WHile this is not stated in the description itself, compared to [Plasma Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Capacitor), the affiliation of Thunderball can still be seen as one related to isorans, while the device itself can be seen of gremlins' origin. Lastly, the [Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex) is one to be `modified with a payload of unstable organic essence` ([Electron Vortex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex)), which we have previously concluded to be Storm Chaser.

##### Spiral Order Modification of Pulsar

As with prior instance of Spiral Order modifying preexisting gremlin technology, such as electron charges and capacitors, shock-themed items, the pattern is observed also across pulsar alchemy tree. Most of their instances within the alchemy tree stem from Spiral Order research, as gremlins rarely mentioned. Yet, the original 2-star [Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar) is described as gremlin technology: `A high-tech Gremlin firearm originally designed for use by elite squads of Ironclaw soldiers` ([Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar)).

Herein, [Catalyzers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Catalyzer) contain seemingly the same underlying technology, judging by design of both weapon itself and its projectiles: `An advanced alchemical armament adapted from Gremlin mining and demolition devices. Catalyzer bullets envelop the enemy in an energy field that explodes after taking damage` ([Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Catalyzer)). Due to its projectiles looking essentially as moonstone versions of dark matter-themed Seerus's [Dark Retribution](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution), we can confidently relate them to a single nature. Its also here we revisit [Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb) due to its similar pattern of orbiting spheres, although here they are not glowing, nor pulsing, - yet, as we have concluded it being of gremlin origin, this design pattern fits well with the _established design of particles as ones closely related to Underworld and gremlin technology_. Due to them looking similar, and the fact Dark Retribution and Arkus utilize the same type of projectiles, we suggest that those are connected by the supernatural nature and stem from a common principles of energy and souls, as ones seen in case of Lord Vanaduke in a lesser variant, _while abiding same orbital-themed movement patterns_. Given __our prior focus on graviton technology, as one attributed to Undercorp, this seems as no coincidence__, essentially being a different application of `unconventional Gremlin theories on physics` ([Electron Bomb](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb)).

As for rest of bombs, paralleling [Static Capacitor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Capacitor), those are all invented by Spiral Order, as all are described as alchemical bombs: [Shivermist Buster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shivermist_Buster), [Venom Veiler](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Veiler), [Torpor Tantrum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torpor_Tantrum), [Shivermist Buster](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shivermist_Buster), [Ash of Agni](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_of_Agni), [Stagger Storm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stagger_Storm): `Though it was originally developed by the Spiral Order to harmlessly subdue dangerous species, how you deal with foes unfortunate enough to be caught in the storm is entirely up to you` [Ash of Agni](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_of_Agni), the alchemical characteristic of those bombs seems intentional to propose those weapons stemming from alchemical expertize of Isorans.

The rest of catalyzer-derived weaponry includes toxic, even radioactive, [Toxic Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxic_Catalyzer): `A Catalyzer modified to fire dangerously radioactive projectiles. Catalyzer bullets envelop the enemy in an energy field that explodes after taking damage` and unmodified, less safe and less stable [Volatile Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volatile_Catalyzer): `Removing the safety overrides from a piece of Gremlin technology is a good way to lose a limb`. The latter seems to suggest that the original catalyzer is designed as gremlins intended, rather than being a Spiral Order modification. It is also here must be noted the extent of Spiral Order engineering, utmost demonstrated by [Virulent Catalyzer](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Virulent_Catalyzer): `The incorporation of Spiral technology has given this harrowing handgun a powerfully poisonous payload`, which marks [Corrosive Acid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Corrosive_Acid): `A caustic substance characteristic of corrosive creatures`, as another material abiding to earlier principle of those being widespread enough for Isorans to discover them on their own. That is with the consideration of this gun being also radioactive, which provides further details on the specifics of Isoran combat strategies.

##### Magitech

To address the magic principle as the part of this section - [Magitech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitech), - based on all of those uses of magic, elemental, materials, we can make a conclusion, that __gremlin civilization had utilized at Clockworks operational facilities__ _not only known physics_, __but magic elementals, graviton technology, and own electricity-based innovations on top of graviton technology__.

It is the definition of the concept of Magitech, although one dependent on the definition of magic as concrete study. As for the cosmology, its vagueness in some of its aspects seems as a definitive application of the magitech concept, without presence of most discrete and concrete laws of the Universe, especially, its other realms, upon which magic phenomena are based.

In order to maintain Clockworks, several complexes are built across it:

- Blast furnaces of clockworks are built and used to melt raw planetary mass. They were built with the usage of _flame souls_.
- Cooling Chamber to maintain stability of its facilities, such as Power Complexes across the Clockworks, through application of _everfrost_.
- Power Complexes are used to wire and distribute energy of the Core across the Clockworks and to the surface, with _storm chasers being an essential element of this process_.
- Wasteworks were collecting residue from smelting and operation of Clockworks, given location's name. As there is an aspect of magic present at the industrial scale, the residue would be likely, as well infused with unnatural properties, manifested as [Plague Essence](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence): `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease`, and its followed attribution to the vile deity.

Lastly, there are skydomes mounted onto gear-like plates. Ths plates themselves are mounted onto large pillars seemingly comprising the structure of Clockworks, which may suggest that each of such pillars operates mostly through its own resources, apart from, of course, the energy, which is most probable to be emitted from the Core and distributed through Power Complexes.

##### Powered-down Clockworks

And yet, despite this guess of Clockworks engineering, the undead-themed depths of Clockwork tunnels, being the Haunted Passage, apart from being vaguely reminiscent of the Unknown Passage with its regular design of tunnels and an intruder, has one peculiar design choice - __the skydomes nor Clockwork pillars are not lit__, - a pattern seen nowhere else, as even the Swarm within its most distinct observed presence within the skydome of the Unknown Passage, _has power, and in excess at that, given pink lightning arcs_, reminiscent of Power Complexes.

This allows us to suggest, that despite thematic difference from other undead locations - Graveyards and Owlite Academy, __Clockworks are influenced by the close presence of Underworld__, resulting in near-total shutdown of its sections, allowing only for its elevators to operate.

This theme reminds us of the unnatural darkness of Underworld, for the first time discussed proper in [relation to Apocrean realm](#analysis-of-apocrean-realm) and [Nefarious Imp]().

It is also worth mentioning, that given similar naming convention to Unknown Passage, we are to argue weather Haunted Passage is a unique location. As Unknown Passage does not change in its layout, we propose, it is a single location present within a single Swarm-infested skydome. Keeping property of layout in mind, we observe in case of Haunted Passage, that it is located outside of skydomes and is comprised of random tunnel segments, which leads us to believe it is rather __an entire area of Clockworks that is haunted__, rather a particular depth.

The passage in this context may be interpreted as a location containing an _un-themed, yellow Clockworks tunnels_ as the Unknown Passage, so the passage term here refers to the __service tunnels of the megastructure__.

And, as haunted passages contain unlit Clockworks, we can further suggest that this paradigm shift - of Clockworks being in such state, - of haunting being present had to happen _after Clockworks' completion_.

#### Weaponization of Undead

Given this context of Underworld-engulfed CLockworks, a specific type of undead had to be explored, seen and relating in particular to the [sealed Isoran vessel in the events of Ghost in the Machine]() - the [Static Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught) and [Frankenzoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frankenzom#Frankenzom).

Both of those seem to be manufactured, artificial entities, as we explore them. We start with [Frankenzoms](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frankenzom#Frankenzom), as they may be seen as more of a gimmick, the dreadnoughts raise more question. As we have covered in the context of Graveyards, only Carnavons and Slug Walkers have a distinct armor, reminiscent of Almire.

Frankenzoms have, seemingly, _augmentations_ as the _metallic shoulder pads and electrically wired pathways on the chest and spine_, as well as large mechanical bolts on the sides of the skull, reminiscent of earlier Frankenstein's monster cinematic designs possessing bolts at the base of the skull.

All [Bombies](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Surging_Bombie#Bombie) have a familiar [3-dot pattern](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/7/70/Monster-Bombie.png), suggesting that they were artificially created, potentially of the same Iron Hulk, as it is most supernatural of all places relating to electricity, even compared to the Power Complexes. But, those same bombies are seen in the areas, most remote, unaffected by incorporation into Clockworks - those being Owlite Castles and, specifically, [Inner Sanctum](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum) of the [Necropolis](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds). Given the excess presence of bombies there, practically uncountable, we can argue that those are the remnants of the Legion of Almire as the rest of enemies found there.

Presence of bombies in that context may be explained in 2 ways:

- Almire had already skill of weaponizing undead, which is unlikely given other information on Almire, as the kingdom is position as one unrelated to undeath, but its separate factions connected to Underworld deities, such being [Almirian graveyards with introduction of Vile deity]() and [Blackened Shrine with Magma Deity]().
- Creation of bombies is a later development. But, the source of this is conflicting, as on one hand we do have Clockwork technology, but on the other, there are traces of fiendish red ritual glyphs, found at [Necropolis Grounds](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds), which may to a later idea of how resurrection of the dead is performed on Cradle and through which means.

As far as bombies are encountered, we are leaning to the ide of them emerging as such through Underworld's presence, unties to a particular party in the material realm. Those specifics of undead may be further affirmed by the phenomenon itself of Dreadnoughts.

#### Grim Totems: Part 2 - Undead Dreadnoughts

Finally, [Static Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught) have unique, futuristic design of shoulder pads and arm guards same as other shock-themed undead discussed above. Those instances of [Static Dreadnoughts](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught) are specific to Dry Docks' enclosure, but general presence of Dreadnoughts is not limited to this location, present also in all variants Firestorm Citadel.

Notably, it is the design of their shoulder pads which is similar to design pattern of 3-star pulsars, specifically [Kilowatt Pulsar](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kilowatt_Pulsar), with its _2 vertical lines_ being present. More so, pulsars' drawn patterns seem to suggest a symbolic application depending on the utilized element or status effect.

So, all Dreadnoughts have an armor, the Almirian Guards even have proper crusader armor. While this factor was important in relation to our proposal of nature of zombies as Isorans, Dreadnoughts still remain as ones _far surpassing any living species in their scale_, more associating with giants than anyone else - an idea, that was suggested when we had inspected [Ancient Plate Armor](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor): `A suit of artifact armor that is said to have been worn by titans. Though it offers amazing protection, its incredible weight makes it cumbersome to wear`.

But, apart from their scale, one common element allows us to understand the nature of dreadnoughts, - their ability to resurrect recently fallen undead as long as perished undead's skull remains intact. This requires us to analyze grim totems now _with all knowledge of current metaphysics in attempt to properly define this power of resurrection_.

By its nature, grim totem is a mechanism most likely originating from the Underworld, as discussed earlier, based on stone-like design with accent on purple energy and incorporation of faces.

The principle behind the resurrection, through observation, is one of a visible wave of purple energy, which, as it propagates over an area, resurrects recently deceased undead from their skulls and reconstructing their bodies.

If we also refer to the idea of spirits returning to material realm on Cradle, we may operate in terms of spirit leaving and returning to the corpse, [haunting it](), allowing resurrection to happen.

As zombies emerge from the graves only as a living being passes nearby them, we may suggest that the souls are not present up to that moment in time. We know, based on instances of Lost Souls, that those are attracted to the living [ones the souls are released proper]().

Could it be, that the same phenomenon happens in regards to graveyards and other instances of undead reacting to presence of the living, such cases being the Phantoms of graveyards and Grimalkin across the Candlestick Keep? This proposal would fit within our operational framework.

Across cultures, it is variable when the soul leaves the body, and in case of our cosmology, we have seen instances of soul leaving instantly - as when Lord Vanaduke was defeated, - with his body remaining and the traces of his [soul with curse being linger within the armor - as finery]().

In case of zombies, presence of a soul is characterized by glowing eyes. And then there are skulls themselves, which in a few instances form an aura around, suggesting haunting. Yet, the are no auras for zombies, but present for phantoms.

This distinction, we believe, while is important, states a characteristic presence of a soul within the skull. But, the energy emission of the totem does not affect dreadnoughts themselves. More so, the resurrected zombies do not contain heat - a shared property with the Void monsters emerging from Swarm sources. As we don't yet know nature of heat, it should be a speculation - _to assume, that the resurrected lack souls_.

Instead, we can attempt to explain it from the _perspective of other devilite technology_ - the cases being of a soul-energy motif:

- Fiendish glyphs, whose operation is of data and energy storage. The latter application is essential for operation of grim gates, which tap into teleportation and transportation over realms.
- Usage and storage of souls indefinitely in everfrost.
- Detection of living beings by monster doors.
- Corrupted tortodrones being powered by power of dark matter mineral, as they were directly disassembled to allow dark matter crystal to be placed.
- Dark matter crystal of trojans being a vulnerable and essential for their survival, being a conduit for their power.

Those factors, this motif of dark matter and energy being tethered together in order to power entities and machinery, we propose, had to be present for all fiendish technology and methodology.

At the same time, that is a case of Blackened Shrine, which is most likely a fiendish device, as suggested by [magma cult]() and [our exploration of this culture](). The shrine has bound Lord Vanaduke's soul to the body, transforming the latter. Compared to this, grim totem only resurrects, but does not transform, albeit it is seen only being used on undead, rather than fiends or the living.

With this, we propose that it is not the soul which is rebound to a corpse, but __its traces being empowered by emitted dark energy__.

This notion of dark energy emissions is coincidentally found in [Phantamos](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos): `A powerful handgun brimming with dark energy. The Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research`. Could it be, that uncontained dark energy by its nature behave as a source of it, essentially, influencing the surroundings as the totem? Given Phantamos, there isa distinct danger and necessity to the containment of dark energy, which is now a far more tangible concept what it was presented originally by Hahn: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` ([The Shadow Knows - Hahn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows)). Notably, Hahn also had utilized the term of _shadow energy_.

This dark energy is then had to be emitted from a source, and this source is contained also in dreadnoughts. As dreadnoughts themselves are undead we are presented with a case, where __shadow energy, as it is described by Hahn__, _could be in greater relation to the dark energy emissions of totem by the fact of both being present in dreadnoughts_?

While for grim totems it is mostly unknown, dreadnoughts possessing same power ties with their nature. We have previously suggested the mythological, which transition into pop-culture, inspirations. And we can derive from this notion more information.

An application of an pop-cultural concept and a spirit of Japanese mythology - Gashadokuro. The key element here is the ability to assemble themselves from the bones of improperly buried, which is fitting for Almire's setting, as well as the general theme of spirits returning to the material realm. As for their armor, we suggest it being of the same phenomenon as Lord Vanaduke's armor, of supernatural origin. We can also male a guess, that the fact dreadnoughts are presented in front of tiles of bones in the Overgrown Court of Shadowplay, we can link those two.

<BookCitation source="Yokai.com, the illustrated database of Japanese folklore, Gashadokuro">

  Soldiers whose bodies rot in the fields and victims of famine who die unknown in the wilderness rarely receive proper funerary rites. Unable to pass on, their souls are reborn as ghosts, longing eternally for that which they once had. These people die with anger and pain in their hearts. That energy remains long after their flesh has rotted from their bones. As their bodies decay, their anger ferments into a grudge against the living, which twists them into a supernatural force. When the bones of hundreds of victims gather together into one mass, they form the humongous, skeletal monster known as the gashadokuro.

  Too large and powerful to be killed, gashadokuro maintain their existence until the energy and malice stored up in their bodies has completely burnt out. However, because of the large amount of dead bodies required to form a single one, these abominations are rarer today than they were in the past, when wars and famine were a part of everyday life.

</BookCitation>

We propose, this exact __grudge against the living is the reanimating force, which makes surrounding dreadnought undead to be resurrected__. This suggestion not only further contextualizes undead Almire, but suggests, that their fate is still undetermined, as it will be proven by existence of Shadow Firestorm Citadel, discussed earlier.

In relation to the grim totems, as much as metaphysics of curse and souls we were concerned with, energy of a soul, and in case of dreadnoughts, supposedly, multiple souls, it is the explanation for the nature of purple or dark energy observed in grim totems.

#### Ghost Blocks, Eyes, and Energy

Ghost blocks possess several unique to Clockworks' environment properties, starting from a carved on their near surface symbol of an eye. Initially found on the Collector and then on the ghost blocks themselves, the symbol is of a familiar eye, usually attributed to Underworld and curse. But, as far as we have discussed appearances of the eye, the context of ghost blocks, even in the color scheme itself, differs drastically.

Even more so, the _emanating light from the ghost block's top is most reminiscent of the depiction of the Core_ in its many depictions with colors white and blue, with particles of burning. It is one of two objects, which possess a counterpart within the Core, the [other being an explosive sphere]().

Yet, as mineral blocks, ghost blocks seem to be made of crude material, reminiscent of stone.

The face of the block itself - the emblem, - given its design of an open radiating top, we believe, is designed as such to __link the emblem, its a glowing iris of the same color as the light, to the source of said light__. The only time we see directly an association of an eye with energy, is, of course, the Swarm and its many depictions both in the Core and outside of it, as well as its craving for Core's energy. This pattern is to be kept in mind.

As for the function of the block - it makes surrounding blocks to disappear in an uncharacteristic to most Clockworks technology manner - _by phasing out of existence in a purple-blue flash of light_. So far, the only matter which is capable of such capabilities is the whitespace blocks from within the Core - as it had appeared, albeit in a white glow, from an empty space both during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](), and the [Unknown Passage]().

At that point we have to keep in the first concept, which might allow to establish greater connection - of a cascading effect, - which is something suggested by large-scale effects of a single ghost block. As we have previously observed a similar phasing effect in phantom-like entities, such as Black Kats, and, by extension, Black Kat Seraphynx, this motif can be phrased as a __capacity of phase out from the material realm at a large scale, related to nature of Whitespace of the Core__. The name of ghost block may in time reveal more information of the _nature of Whitespace itself and physical principles of its operation_.

Then there is a concept of _pairing eyes to energy_, with an iris being an important element to linking the two, which we will keep a track of once we gat to the analysis of the Core and all of accompanying it entities.

Within this paradigm ghost blocks seem to come from a differnt period of time, or at least provide a cultural connection between symbol of an eye and energy of the Core. As heavy statues come from a differnt period of time, greatly preceding gremlins, we propose that ghost blocks are of the similar origin, - one, we suggest, attibuted to Owlites as they expand their understanding of metaphysics near the time Divine Avenger was created, mainly due to lack of stonework motifs across gremlin civilization.

#### Alchemy Stations, Orbs of Alchemy and Alchemical Transmutation

As it was stated earlier, electricity seems to be regarded as one of more important aspects of Clockworks' design, up to the point of its presence as lightnings above the Core at depth 29, as well as within the Unknown Passage, wherein same arcs of lightning are now integrated into the nature of the Swarm. Lightnings and abundance of power is predominantly focused within Power Complexes.

Power Complexes are populated by shock-themed enemies, including quicksilver lichens. Quicksilver in alchemy was often associated with the concept of the Prima Materia, and represented the soul. The dual nature of mercury, which is essentially quicksilver, - both a liquid metal and a toxic substance, - has contributed to its symbolism in alchemy, representing both transformation and danger.

This points us to further presence of dualities within Clockworks. Alchemists of western cultures sought to understand and manipulate these transformative properties in their quest for the philosopher's stone and the secrets of creation of matter and achieving immortality. Following this idea of alchemical symbolism and prior knowledge of magitech motifs, we can make an educated guess on the nature of energy. As we have proposed, energy is derived from the Nameless Realm and energy was associated with the concept of salt through its symbolism. Salt, in alchemy, in one of its many interpretation, is one of three primes. Essentially, it is one of elements from which all of matter is built. Yet, the more prominent idea of energy as omnipresent in its different forms relates to a concept in alchemy of Prime Matter.

Here we should note on the _widespread presence of alchemy stations across Cradle and Clockworks_. Their design, evident by two-layered frame below the display, is of Clockworks rather than of Spiral Order, - designed by gremlins and then used by Strangers and Isorans.

We have previously proposed, that the concept of energy and later of Spiral is a universal constant. This way we explained seemingly unrelated presence of energy, or salt, and symbol on both Isoran and Valkyrian armors. Through the identification of Forgotten time, we have suggested a deeper relation between Isorans and celestial beings, which were potentially Owlites.

Then there was symbol of orbs of alchemy or of the alchemy, - of transmutation, itself. As it is depicted on modern alchemy station and tomes of rage, descending from valkyries to a time of existing dragons, we suspect it being a universal phenomenon. Then there is __Sanctuary Alchemy Station, which is explicitly designed with this symbol crowning the device__, _instead of depicting it on the display_.

Given our notion of applying alchemical interpretation, we suggest, that _Orbs of Alchemy are philosopher's stones, as they serve as the catalyst for the transmutation itself_. But, their origins remains unknown, as they are uncraftable, with the a few ways of their acquisition being discovery across Clockworks or a purchase for energy in Supply Depot.

If we develop this idea further, we whould also acknowledge a unique design of Sanctuary Alchemy Station - as the main interface is accessed through a shape vaguely similar to one of alchemy stations across Clockworks, where the latter are likely meant to imitate the design of thr Sanctuary Alchemy Station, - the foundation requires a knight to ascent a staircase, and met with a pool of water, from which in a root-like patterns white fragmented matter connects to the interface of the alchemy station. As the motif of water was vaguely introduced in relation to Blinding Abyss, but more importantly, in relation to divine water from Spirit Mother's realm, as one capable of clensing the curse and extinguishing shadow fires. We suggest, that this water, which is seen in the Sanctuary is ino to be potentiall identified as water of Spirit Mother's realm, and, as the _philosophical water_ within alchemical framework, aqua mercurialis, which is also prima materia, sharing their properties. This symbolism is one we have to keep track of.

The prior scenario presumes existence of Orbs of Alchemy before Isorans or even Strangers, and given context of Sanctuary Alchemy Station, we are leaning to either them being devised by gremlins, or coming before gremlins. The latter scenario requires elaboration - and that is mostly due to presence of the same symbol for civilizations, which we ruled out to be not related to Clockworks - Valkyries, but related deeply with the Sleeper, a deific entity, and [a benefactor at the heart of the supposed heavenly kingdom](). With this, Orbs of Alchemy can be seen as a universal constant - an essential element to existence and operation of alchemy and transmutation.

Here, we have to look also at the design of Orbs of Alchemy, specifically, their golden frame as one reminiscent of Cradle's arm, seemingly being contained in a mechanical frame. The interior of alchemy orbs is of bright lights, whose amount increases depending on the star rarity of the orb. We will return to the themes of gold in relation to alchemy and nature of Whitespace. But, compared to orbs of alchemy, Cradle's arm does not seemingly possess a quality of containing the enclosed structure, but rather seem to be stucture for a triangular pointer of the same maetallic material to be mounted at it. Notably, the pointed is absent in the infographics on activated console's interface in the events of Shadowplay. This design is most reminiscent of a _mounting and rotating mechanism of a terrestirial globe model_, which may potentially hint at Cradle's purpose as one concealing Clockworks for a specific goal, incliding their corresponding terms.

This leaves us with the last notion we have kept in mind - as alchemy works as a universal constant, - the technology gremlins use, that of ghost blocks, explosive blocks and vortex blocks not only, partially, mimicks contents of the Core, but has 2 more symbolic elements to it:

- The sphere confined in a cube is a symbolic representation of a _squared circle_ - a motif found in alchemy, identical to completion of Great Work.
- The votex-like behavior of vortex block, explosive nature of explosive blocks, and illusive property of ghost block rreminds us of 3 primordial forces of frenzy, rage and storms.

#### King Tinkinzar

King Tinkinzar, as a figure, is deeply related to the nature and origin of Crimson Order and foundation of Clockworks as a megastructure. If we approach this relation from Herex's point of view, one of deep despise towards the order: `The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world` ([Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Danger Module - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Danger_Module:_Hidden_Hideout)) we observe an inversion of what Seerus says in the Engines of War: `The Nine see all, hear all` - a relation of the Order to senses of sight and hearing. Than Seerus states: `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!` which makes, we suspect, an accent on both on the importance of the figure of the king, and a role of hands. Those phrases are found at the monitors with the imagery of Crimson Order symbol. This design pattern, as well as the [analysis of Iron Law](), is reminiscent of Big Brother of "1984" by George Orwell and his quotes, depicted on the telescreens.

As it was previously pointed out: `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` ([Bootshuze](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze)) - it frames Tinkinzar as an embodiment of a particular trope - [the philosopher king](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopherKing), a scientist-king, and here, implied creator of Clockworks, which are, by the factor of scale and greater entities at play, is the definition of megastructure with cosmic horror at hand.

Then there is the symbolism of Iron Law and Great Colony's emblem, already covered, but in a current context requiring elaboration. While the bolt is held within the teeth of a wrench is a subject of symbolic interpretation of an iron grip on gremlins ideology, on the contrary, there is Crimson Throne itself and Crimson Order insignia, which has only a single depiction of a wrench proper, in both cases not tightening the bold, but present within the gear, a less enforcing imagery, even suggesting a duality of both, as one requires the other for the metaphorical machine to operate.

There, teeth of the gear are generally accepted as being members of the Crimson Order, while the wrench, we suggest, is the king himself, evident by imagery of same wrench on Seerus's Crimson Throne. This depiction, we believe, is not a manner of Seerus's character, but an attribution of a member of Crimson Order at his own facility, a nobility of an order within a kingdom.

Those similarities, as well as the implied longevity and a supposed benevolence of king Tinkinzar in contrast with the realities of gremlin civilization had initially lead us to the conclusion of concept of a great gremlin king being engineered specifically by Crimson Order, if we work strictly from lack of any physical evidence of his existence. But, the symbolism at absence of physical evidence is what we were operating through the analysis, as symbols' consistency is one which may allow encoded within concept to resurface.

We would have concluded at that, if not for the existence of the Architect:

`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

More notions arise from notes of the Alpha Squad by framing Clockworks in the similar manner from the perspective of not an abstract entity, but Isorans: `This is a world designed to confuse its travelers. It wants to trap and destroy them. I'm starting to think its like a cat, toying with its prey before delivering the final blow` ([Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

Due to total absence of any entity remotely reminiscent of the Architect, apart from abstraction of the Swarm, but one which is not Sleeper itself, the single and only lead we see is that the Architect is king Tinkinzar.

With this in mind, with the idea of Great Colony, and Iron Law, we can attempt to guess the logic behind the Artifact and Consoles deeper role based on the design element of the two and a relation to the Core at a symbolic and thematic level.

#### Consoles: Part 2 - Divine Clockworks and Whitespace

The Artifact and Consoles are connected by the fact of working, as far as direct observation suggest, as a key and a lock. Yet, to understand this relation and its precise effects, we are required to be aware of the designs of Whitespace, of what distinguishes it from the rest of depths in greatest detail. We will perform this analysis in multiple iterations, looking as the entire system's elements.

First, 3 new concepts are introduced by Whitespace, one that is most certainly located within the Core during the events of [Dreams and Nightmares](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_nightmares):

- Existence of White Clockwork or Whitespace Clockwork tunnels at the start of the [Step Beyond](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond), a platform, reminiscent of the beginning of the [Unknown Passage](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage):

  - Both platform have similar proportions: 9 tiles width, and 9 tiles depth, whitespace version has 10 tiles depth.
  - Both versions have 4x4 4 Clockworks tunnel pillars on each angle of the main platform.
  - Through the border of the platform goes a single pipe.
  - But, Unknown Passage's platform has 3 paths extending from it, white Whitespace has only a single path obscured by the different material comprised of physical Whitespace matter.

- Transition from the design of Clockwork tunnels to an abstract shapes of cubes of Whitespace proper.

  - It partially reminds of the design choice present in the Unknown Passage, as portion of the tunnel was destroyed, Whitespace forms, the cubes, filled it in order for knight to pass over the gap.

_White Clockwork tunnels are seen only once outside of the Core_ - in the [Divine theme](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Theme_(Guild_Hall)) of the Guild Hall. It is the last and most expensive upgrade, requiring most of the Guild Hall to be unlocked and active. This connection - of Whitespace theme being referred as the divine, - __establishes a relation between the nature of divine color scheme and divine implications of Whitespace__. This statement will be the foundation for our further analysis. But, on its own it could've been written off as an asset reuse, a case we were encountering a few time for now.

Instead, our investigation of Nameless Realm and other deific figures from the other chapters, which revolve around Owlites, becomes relevant. Particularly, it is the nature of heavenly kingdom, also identified as the paradise, whose role was important in relation to Fallen Valkyrian is what interests us _as a preestablished metaphysical system prior to arrival of gremlin empire_. Of all of the experiences of the divine for Owlites and Valkyries, nature of the paradise and of heavenly kingdom is [one we have suggested to be a precursor for existence of Whitespace within the Core]() as both possess a distinct deific features, and _offer a resolution for a later question of inception or discovery of the Sleeper by gremlins_.

Now, keeping this paradigm in mind, as proper identification of Whitespace requires us to keep track both of _classical, mythologic motifs_ established in relation to heavenly kingdom, and now _alchemical motifs_ of gremlins of modern period of time in general.

For the most part, divine-themed equipment is related to heavenly kingdom. But the difference here arises from the particular colors, as monochrome and occasional gold of Whitespace is not attributed to the divine color scheme. A more fitting connection through monochromatic pattern is attributed to the [Grey Prise Box](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Prize_Box). So far we are only concerned with a peculiarity of grey as one containing all of battle sprites in this form, disregarding their origin.

Grey prize box contains replicas of every accessory. This pattern is similar to the white Clockworks in the Core, with an addition of [grey aura](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Aura#Grey_Aura), which darkens the surroundings. We have the explanation behind this design, but it requires understanding role of the Swarm first, which will be discussed soon.

One more element of the grey prize box in particular is the [silver personal color](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silver_Personal_Color#Silver_Personal_Color), as silver is the heavenly metal within this cosmology - as [Sun Silver](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver): `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky`, and the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore): `An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above`, - relating back to the celestials, supposed Owlites.

Silver, by nature of the name, is associated with Sun Silver - a gold-like material, and yet, here silver is monochrome, and appears even in a corresponding, _colorless_ prize box. A note must be made here on the pure grey design of non-prismatic elements of [Heavenly iron Helm](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm) which is transmuted with the introduction of the [Celestial Ore](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore), but itself, is mostly lacks color.

The third design concept found in Whitespace is of the __square spiral__. As in case of the [first introduction](#concept-of-spiral) of this form, we are searching for patterns:

- Walkways of the Step Beyond depths have transitory square spiral patterns.
- Patterns of square spirals present on the gates - enemy gates and golden key gates.

  The prior, notably, has image of an eye with significantly larger iris and pinkish purple color, reminiscent of curse more than Swarm's pink.

- Square spiral pattern is also observed across [Mysterious Consoles and the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact). It will be the point of the further analysis.

Then, outside of the Core, bur relating to it, there are 3 main elements to the console itself: the display, a platform, and a slot for the Artifact, evident by a placement of 2 vertical rods of the Artifact.

The notable element of the console, which, we believe, is a solid proof of Console's gremlin origin, is the design of the console below the display. It is a curved structure of metal with internal components of dark metal and external plating of more bright color. And exactly on the latter, _on each side of the console, there are 3-stub ends placed in a radial shape with a circled hole below_. __It is the exact design of the Clockwork elevators__ - each side of which contains that exact design up to the inner and outer plating. Except for the color of the outer plating is more contrast. There are brass components of the grid floor of the console, which hold the wires. Color of those elements is the same as the component of the same design around the moving Clockwork elevators' platform.

Ironwork-like designs on the outer and inner circles of the console's platform surrounding the grid and the pattern the Artifact's lid are similar - __the very square spiral, is the Greek key__ - a part of the more general meander pattern. Greek key specifically was found across _Greek and Roman architecture_. With this, now we can now look for shared patterns in attempt to fill in whitespaces in gremlin civilization's history.

Due to utmost proximity of Consoles' design to the Whitespace, we can gather that this design has greater importance to gremlin civilization, or at least, its inner party, such as Crimson Order, as nowhere else any symbolic element is present apart of Crimson Order insignia itself or the gremlin emblem. More so, the _mirroring of reality outside of the Core within the Whitespace_, and concept of mirrors in general, is one we are tracking since identification of a [motif of dreaming both for Apocrea and Sleeper]() as two thematic opposites, yet being similar in that regard.

The last components of the console are the display itself and slot for the artifact. While there is not much, currently, in regards to the slot Artifact is placed in, the display as well as the Artifact's lid contain symbols, which we will identify as gremlin written language.

#### Gremlin Conlang

Based on the encountered instances of gremlin written language, or rather their written system, we will use for the description of those symbols in this document [unicode block symbols](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode/blocks/block-elements/). Those symbol are encountered in 3 instances - _Console_ with the _Artifact_, and the _Roarmulus Twins_.

The important thing is to establish is how to transcribe them, - does the dark element of the square fill the letter, or it is the white form we are looking for? To solve this, e have to look at physical letters. One such instance is on the side of the lid, covering the Artifact during activation - those symbols, judging by the lightning, are located in front of the darker elements. We consider this as the guide.

Then there is the direction in which those symbols are read. As console screen depicts rows as, likely, notations to the pulse flow from left to right, we can guess that the gremlin conlang is written horizontally from left to right. But the instance of the console screen does not tell of what are the symbols there - as we can consider the white squared as background, or as part of letters. To solve it, we appeal to the earlier case of symbols on the inner plate layer of the lid of the Artifact clot container, as there, there would be no need to carve with such intricacy the individual blocks.

- This, we believe, leads us to interpret the white background as if the color is inverted, meaning that the patter of the symbol is black.
- The same logic is then applied to the row of 3 symbol on the container's lid - reading there only black patterns.
- On the other inner metal plate on the horizontal dimension of the lid we look for white pattern on black background.
- The Roarmulus Twins' symbols are the black patterns

<div class="code-conlang">

As a result, we get the following symbols:

- Console
  - Console screen
    - Leftmost section
      - `▝` `▄` - a pulse line extends from this row
      - `▄` `▘` `▟`
      - `▞` `▗` `▌` - a pulse line extends from this row
      - `▟` `▝` `▗` `▝`
      - `▀` `▄` `▘` - a pulse line extends from this row
    - Pulse line annotations
      - `▝` `▚` `█` `_` `▛`
      - `▘` `▟` `▘` `▄` `▌`
      - `█` `▗` `▀` `▙` `▝` - positioned above rightmost pulse line
    - Rightmost section
      - `▗` `▀` `▄`
      - `▖` `▟` `▌`
      - `▐` `▞` `█`
    - Energy pips. Those are located in a lower half of the holographic interface and depict:
      - Below the leftmost section Cradle infographic with the Moon and the Arm, with pip depicting a flow from top to bottom.
      - Below rightmost section the Artifact infographic with distinct 3 circles is seen. Flow of pips is seen to go from bottom to top.
  - Artifact Container Lid
    - `▗` `▀` `▙` - side of the lid, engraved on the outer metal plate layer
    - `█` `_` `▛` `▗` `▀` - Side of the lid is mirrored on both sides retaining its orientation. This means, that one of the readings - a side upon which it is read, is incorrect. Since the previous line is not symmetrically places, we will consider this orientation as correct.
    - The last text is on top of the lid, and it is as large as the console screen text. In fact, it is the same image, all of the lines from the console screen are appended to the leftmost block's last line.
- Artifact

  All of its 3 circles have the same pattern. We will looks for the black symbols on light background.

  `x` - marks lack of circle's surface

  `_` - marks lack of light on the surface

  The result is: `x` `▀` `x` `▐` `▞` `█` `▗` `x` `x` `▟` `x` `▖` `_` `▌` `▄` `x`

- Roarmulus Twins

  - Marking pointing to the right eye and the foundation with an arrow: `▀`

    Due to lack of space above the block, we can conclude that is only symbol possible to fit. And, due to to presence of a next line on the armor plate, we will read it in the same direction.

  - Arrows pointing to armor plates' joints: `_` `▀` `▟` `█` `▌` `▌`

    There are several issues with this transcription:

    - The last 2 repeating symbol is an uncommon pattern.
    - We can gather, that the `█` is incorrect, which will lead followed symbols to be interpreted incorrectly. There is a possibility of `▐` being present.
    - But the one to last symbol has vertical side with a pit, followed to the left exactly as the width of `▌`, leaving the questionable symbol on the left, as one similar to triangle. No such symbol is seen anywhere else.
    - The last symbol, due to lack of boxes, could be as `▌` as `▐`. So, due to this, we have to operate on those symbol with a possibility of error inherited in the transcription.

    This line is found in multiple instances, always pointing to a point of 2 plates connecting, which might five a hint to its meaning.

  Notably, the texture of the Roarmulus Blueprints has all metal notches depicted as on the Twins themselves.

Based on this, we can arrange a table of repetitions of each symbol:

<center>
  <GremlinConlang />
</center>

</div>

Mention of gremlin cryptography in the Aftermath: `It'll take forever to decipher gremlin cryptography` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Aftermath]), may be related to this language.

But the presented instances of the language, we believe, seemingly being encrypted, as in case of Roarmulus twins, they serve as markings on the joints of armor plates; and in case of Mysterious Console and Artifact, they seem to be operational instructions or a manual, as they are present both on top of the lid and in the holographic display, serving functional purpose - and, seemingly, infographic one.

The other, more probable case of those symbols being __native written form of gremlin language__.

We come to this conclusion based on the aforementioned context of symbols' placement, as those location are not likely to be intentionally encrypted, but rather seem to be a simple language barrier.

In fact, there is one more case of a language barrier during the events of [Operation Greenhorn](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/Operation_Greenhorn). In the Strangers' town, likely Haven, gremlins have a different pattern of speaking: `Greetings, little. One. Don't step. On snipes`, `Greetings. Get Shinies. Get Shinies`, `Snipes. Buy? Sell?` ([Strangers](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/Operation_Greenhorn)).

The existence of a language barrier in the latter case suggests, that there is at least one other language within gremlin society, potentially, in conjunction with a low literacy level within gremlin society, given its more grim themes, paired with wide presence of, at least, militaristic motifs.

Notably, low literacy level was encountered one other time, in relation to an undead Kat Tribe: `It appears that illiteracy is still rampant among the black kat hordes, so they have once more taken to eating the pilfered pages rather than using them for arcane rituals` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025)) and `Black kats are the darkest souls of the former Kat Tribe. They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation - Pembrooke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue)).

Among several instances of our tests in attempt to decipher this, potentially incomplete, language we came to a suggestion, which takes foundation in taoism, as several our topics regarding nature of energy and souls. Specifically, what is the symbols on the console and the Artifact were not meant to represent works, but rather chained together concepts, reminiscent of taoist trigrams?

The very fact that gremlin symbols are not enumerable for complete english alphabet, 15 symbols and a lack of one, are relatively similar both in count and rectangular shape to the aforementioned 8 trigrams, or 64 hexagrams, which correspond to more precise concepts. While this is a speculation, it fits with a few concepts which seemingly were derived of eastern philosophies explored earlier, specifically of those which had its influence onto alchemy in both western and eastern tradition.

#### Gremlin Schematics

We have extensively covered the facility where the schematics are located being complex 357.

We have analyzed the room the supposed schematics were located. Based on those we can came to a series of suggestion, each relating to its room in the facility:

- East room: gun block and its target, supposedly set up for testing.
- West room: Chemicals, minerals, and slime samples.
- Norse room: Ancient tomes with a potential to relate to Owlites.

How those objects relate to gremlins?

The east room had a canon, which is a common militaristic motif of gremlins on Cradle. The slime is known to be repurposed and changed by gremlins for the purpose of artificial subspecies of slimes used for operation of Clockworks' service facilities.

As for Owlites, as far as tomes' design goes and their usage of elementals for the operation of Clockworks, seem to be the primary and the deepest lead we can identify.

We could've also looked into other instances of gremlin schematics - and those relate to:

- `If this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components. Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis. It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R` [Plant of Attack](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack).
- `Gremlin construction sites often contain valuable schematics of gremlin structures and even weaponry. Once obtained by Spiral HQ, they provide rare insights into gremlin engineering. Gremlin schematics are typically stored in terminals somewhere on site. These terminals are locked down and heavily guarded` [Hazardous Heist](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Heist).

But, compared to those, complex 357 lacks any terminals to extract those schematics. And given presence of paper clips, as well as books, we can suggest those being written on paper medium - an uncommon decision given gremlin cryptography is seemingly advanced enough even for Spiral Order, judging by the dialogue in the Aftermath: `It'll take forever to decipher gremlin cryptography` ([Operation Crimson Hammer - Aftermath - knight right of Feron]). Apart from being not digitalized, likely kept in secrecy, then, there is not much we can derive from those speculations. There are, as discussed, several aspects to those elements of the complex:

- Study of [rocket blocks](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Rocket_Block.png), connection to mineral/crystal blocks and capacity to demolish those
- Excess presence of aforementioned crystals across complex grounds.
- Valestone being grinded to powder and ancient tomes.

As far as we have researched, we are unable to decipher the written form of the language. That is if it is an instance of a completed language. And, considering that most of this symbols would not be looked at, despite their consistency, it may be an unfinished set of characters or one we could not solve so far.

In this context, the language is only important as its placement to the understanding contents of the schematics. And given our prior analysis of the complex, the context - the time Herex had infiltrated it prior to Shadowplay, - we make a guess, that the schematics, to an unknown degree, should describe foundational elements of Clockworks or even the Core.

Then there are Herex's recon modules, with prior instances usually hinting his direct and physical presence in the past - such cases being Razwog's facility and Hidden Hideout with the first direct hint of Swarms' existence. Due to existence of those instances, we come to suggest, that Herex was present, at least, in the northern room of the complex, which can hint at our reasoning of those rooms containing the schematics.

If it is so, then, at least the room containing ancient tomes is the one connected the most with the contents of the schematics.

And now, if we recall the earlier chapters' discussions [regarding nature and symbolism of Nameless Realm]() and [Metaphysical Stack](), and how we have proposed Sleeper to be an energy-based entity same as Spirit Mother, it would be a proper question to ask, - _how gremlins have discovered Whitespace in the first place?_ And if they did not discover it, opened, or created, how this greater relation with Sleeper within the Core had begun?

In order to prevent ourselves from diving into the relation with the Sleeper, Core, Clockworks and the Swarm, we may relate to one element, mentioned by Parma in the Refuge: `Apologies for not appearing in person. I'm hidden away in a safe place. I knew I'd never make it here in time when I noticed your signal. Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit` ([Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge)).

The fact Knight can get lost within the Whitespace of the Core, which itself can be controlled through unknown means, we can make a proposal.

Given further relation of gremlins to the Core, Consoles, and the Artifact, we propose, that the __schematics describe the specification - the mechanical design, a blueprint of the Core__, which allow both to navigate and understand it as a megastructure revolving around physical principles, distinct from ones commonly observed in the material realm, albeit without inclusion of the Swarm, but, with consideration of Whitespace itself as the contents of the Core.

We are yet to understand, what is responsible for chaotic pathways within the Core, - weather it is effect of Swarm's presence or a natural environment, as one related to the Nameless Realm, in both instances retrieval of specification of the Core as a man-made location completely alien to the rest of Cradle seems to be a proper step of preparations before descending into one.

It can be argued that members of Crimson Order should be capable of understanding and traversing the Clockworks, yet, there is no evidence of such principles being directly applied nor observed. As far Spiral Order is aware, there is at least one instance of anomalous movement of large region across Clockworks, being Firestorm Citadel: `We thought things were getting pretty predictable, even at the depths you've been exploring. The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. We don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing. This is bad news` ([Ending in Fire - Kora](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire)).

#### Console: Part 3 - Artifact, Console, and a Hatch

It is suggested, that combination of the Artifact and console is capable of opening the Core. The terms of generator and the Artifact will be used interchangeably.

Ancient [Generator](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact) can contain some amount of energy, as evident by Herex and Razwog dialogue, as Razwog was tasked to find a way to power the Generator: `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` [Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven) and `Too late again! I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion` ([Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room)). This energy, supposedly, allows t to power the console, as seen in the events of Shadowplay.

Originally, the generator is made known of in the Power Complex-[like](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-The_Ancient_Generator-Restoring_Power.png) facility, with wires [going up into the platform with the Artifact](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:TheArtifact-FirstSight.png). Both wires of the activated console and wires found all across Clockworks have the same animation of being powered, as a pulse of blue light travels across them. This design - of an idea of energy being transferred, - is similar to the pulse lines fo
