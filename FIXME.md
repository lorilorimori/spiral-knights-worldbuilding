### FIXME

- `that` never follows a comma, its closure is not denoted by commas, unless its a interruption (`that is`)

  https://www.brandeis.edu/writing-program/resources/students/academic/style-grammar/comma-rules.html

  - `\,[\s\_]+that` ch 1-6 ok
  - `\,\_+that`

- `which` should clause optional info and then its clause is wrapped in commas. May be used with essential info, but it'll informal


### TODO

- comma:
  - `, referred as`
  - `, hence`
  - `, as well as`
  - `-- ..., --`,

- `Apocrean Realm` -> `Apocrean realm`


### CONSIDER

- tortomega were not hunted by valkyries
- candlestick keep statues/busts are of deveilites, not tortomega
- lumbers - effort of gremlin industry + devilte tech of placing seals onto essences
- howlitzers are wyverns or dragons
- nefarios imp is not a prominent figure. it is affiliated with Underworld but its not a primary antagonist
